\begin{abstract}
	This manuscript develops a geometric approach to ordinary cohomology of smooth manifolds, constructing a cochain complex model based on co-oriented smooth maps from manifolds with corners.
	Special attention is given to the pull-back product of such smooth maps, which provides our geometric cochains with a partially defined product structure inducing the cup product in cohomology.
	A parallel treatment of homology is also given allowing for a geometric unification of the contravariant and covariant theories.
