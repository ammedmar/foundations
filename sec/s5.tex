\section{Basic properties of geometric (co)homology and equivalence with singular (co)homology}\label{S: basic properties}

In this section, we establish the basic properties of geometric homology and cohomology, including functoriality with respect to \textit{continuous} maps in \cref{S: functoriality} and Mayer-Vietoris sequences in \cref{S: MV}.
In \cref{S: homology is homology}, this allows us to show that geometric homology and cohomology are equivalent to (absolute) singular homology and cohomology on manifolds, using a result of Kreck and Singhof.
In the case of homology, we will also construct in \cref{S: homology direct} an explicit isomorphism from smooth singular homology to geometric homology.
It is more challenging to find an explicit isomorphism in the case of cohomology, and, in fact, the bulk of \cref{S: transversality} will be dedicated to such a construction.

\subsection{Functoriality and homotopy properties}\label{S: functoriality}

Given a \textit{continuous} map of smooth manifolds $f \colon M \to N$, we define in this section the induced maps $f_* \colon H_*^\Gamma(M) \to H_*^\Gamma(N)$ and $f^* \colon H^*_\Gamma(N) \to H^*_\Gamma(M)$ and show that they are independent of $f$ up to homotopy.
In subsequent sections, we will sometimes write the homology map simply as $f$ when the context is clear.

We also treat ``wrong way'' maps, though they require extra hypotheses.
In particular, if $f$ is proper and co-oriented it induces a covariant map on cohomology $f_* \colon H^*_\Gamma(M) \to H^{*+n-m}_\Gamma(N)$ independent of $f$ up to proper homotopy,
while if $f$ is proper and $M$ is oriented, we have a contravariant homology map $f^* \colon H_*^\Gamma(N) \to H_{*+m-n}^\Gamma(M)$.

In the covariant cases, $M$ and $N$ may both be manifolds with corners if we assume all maps and homotopies to be smooth (primarily to avoid smoothing arguments for maps of manifolds with corners).
In the contravariant case, we need to use both transversality and smoothing, and so for this case we consider only $M$ and $N$ without boundary.

The construction of $f_*$ for homology is relatively straightforward and can essentially be found in \cite[Section 6]{Lipy14}, though we provide additional details.
The covariant case of cohomology is similar to that for homology.
For the contravariant cases, there is slightly more work, and our argument here for cohomology parallels Kreck's in \cite{Krec10}, which is slightly different than the sketch in Lipyanskiy \cite[Section 6]{Lipy14} in that we choose to perturb $f$ rather than the reference map for the cohomology class in order to obtain transversality for the purpose of performing pullbacks.

As part of our constructions, we will see that if $F \colon M \times I \to N$ is a homotopy (proper or co-oriented as need be) and $r_W \colon W \to M$ represents a geometric cycle or cocycle, then the composition $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I)$ provides a homology or cohomology from $F(-,0)r_W \colon W \to N$ to $F(-,1)r_W \colon W \to N$.
Such homotopies, which we dub ``universal homotopies,'' will be critical in later sections for making geometric chains and cochains transverse to each other.

\subsubsection{Covariant functoriality of geometric homology and cohomology}\label{S: covariant functoriality}

In this section we consider the covariant behavior of geometric chains and cochains under maps and homotopies.
Both $M$ and $N$ may have corners in this section unless noted otherwise.
We begin with smooth maps but will generalize later to continuous maps via smooth approximation, at which time we will assume $M$ and $N$ are without boundary.

If $r_W \colon W \to M$ is in $PC_*^\Gamma(M)$ and $f \colon M \to N$ is a smooth map, then the composition $fr_W \colon W \to N$ is in $PC^\Gamma_*(N)$.
Consistent with our notation of writing $W \in PC_*^\Gamma(M)$, we write the image in $PC_*^\Gamma(N)$ as $f(W)$.
Similarly, if $f$ is proper and co-oriented we obtain a map $PC^*_\Gamma(M) \to PC^{*+n-m}_\Gamma(N)$ that we also write as $W \to f(W)$.
In this case the change of degree is because $W$ represents an element of degree $m-w$ in $PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ and of degree $n-w$ in $PC^{*}_\Gamma(N)$.
Functoriality is clear, and both $\bd(f(W))$ and $f(\bd W)$ are represented by $fr_Wi_{\bd W}$.
To obtain chain maps\footnote{We will not require here the signs that sometimes accompany chain maps of non-zero degree.} $C_*^\Gamma(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(N)$ and $C^*_\Gamma(M) \to C^{*+n-m}_\Gamma(N)$
(that we also write as $f$), it suffices to show that if $W \in Q(M)$ then $f(W) \in Q(N)$.
This is the content of the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{L: Q preservation}
	If $r_W \colon W \to M$ represents an element of $Q_*(M)$ (or $Q^*(M)$) and $f \colon M \to N$ is any (co-oriented proper) smooth map, then $fr_W \colon W \to N$ is in $Q_*(N)$ (or $Q^{*+n-m}(N)$, co-orienting $fr_W$ with the composition co-orientation).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	First consider $W \in Q_*(M)$.
	By assumption, $W$ is the disjoint union of a trivial manifold over $M$ given by $r_T \colon T \to M$ and a degenerate manifold over $M$ given by $r_D:D \to M$.
	If $\rho \colon T \to T$ is an orientation-reversing diffeomorphism of $W$ such that $r_T\rho = r_T$ then also $fr_T\rho = fr_T$, so $fr_T \colon T \to N$ is also trivial.
	Furthermore, if $r_D$ has small rank then certainly so does $fr_D$.
	Similarly, $\bd(fr_D)$ is a union of trivial and small rank manifolds over $N$, and so $fr_D:D \to M$ is degenerate.

	The proof for $W \in Q^*(M)$ is the same using that the composition of proper maps is proper and the composition of co-oriented maps is co-oriented.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Lipyanskiy's Theorem 4]\label{C: homology chain map}
	Given a smooth map $f \colon M \to N$ of manifolds (possibly with corners), there is an induced chain map $C_*^\Gamma(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(N)$ given by $\uW \to \underline{f(W)}$, and this construction gives a covariant functor from the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps to chain complexes over $\Z$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}\label{C: proper cofunctoriality}
	Given a smooth proper co-oriented map $f \colon M \to N$ of manifolds (possibly with corners), there is an induced chain map $C^*_\Gamma(M) \to C^{*+n-m}_\Gamma(N)$ given by $\uW \to \underline{f(W)}$, and this construction gives a covariant functor from the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps to cochain complexes over $\Z$ with chain maps of degree $n-m$.
\end{corollary}

Next we consider behavior with respect to homotopies.
For the remainder of the section, and for simplicity of notation, we leave degree shifts tacit in the notation; for example, for a chain complex $A_*$, we write $x \in A_*$ to mean an element of any degree and simply write $f \colon A_* \to B_*$ even when $f$ is a chain map of non-zero degree.

\begin{convention}\label{homotopy product co-orientation convention}
	If $r_W \colon W \to M$ is co-oriented, then we co-orient $r_W \times \id_I \colon W \times I \to M \times I$ so that if $(\beta_W,\beta_M)$ is the co-orientation at $x \in W$ then $(\beta_W \wedge \beta_I,\beta_M \wedge \beta_I)$ is the co-orientation at $(x,t)$ for any $t \in I$, with $\beta_I$ being the standard orientation of the interval.
\end{convention}

We will also need the following observations for the co-oriented cases.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $r_W \colon W \to M$ be co-oriented, and let $r_W \times \id \colon W \times I \to M \times I$ be co-oriented by \cref{homotopy product co-orientation convention}.
	For $j = 0,1$, let $i_j \colon W = W \times j \into W \times I$ and $k_j \colon M = M \times j \into M \times I$ be the inclusions, co-oriented with the usual boundary co-orientation (\cref{D: boundary co-orientation}).
	Then for $j = 0,1$, the following diagram of co-oriented maps commutes:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
		W \arrow[r, "r_W"] \arrow[hookrightarrow,d, "i_j"'] & M \arrow[hookrightarrow,d, "k_j"] \\
		W \times I \arrow[r, "r_W \times \id"] & M \times I.
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Commutativity as maps is clear, so we focus on the co-orientations.

	Let $w \in W$, and suppose the co-orientation of $r_W$ at $w$ is represented by $(\beta_W, \beta_M)$.
	Let $\nu_W$ and $\nu_M$ denote inward pointing normal vector fields to $W \times j$ and $M \times j$ in $W \times I$ and $M \times I$, respectively. If $j=0$, then the co-orientation of $i_0$ at $w$ is $(\beta_W, \beta_W \wedge \beta_{\nu_W}) = (\beta_W, \beta_W \wedge \beta_I)$, where $\beta_I$ is the standard orientation of $I$, while if $j=1$, the co-orientation of $i_1$ is $(\beta_W, \beta_W \wedge \beta_{\nu_W}) = (\beta_W, \beta_W \wedge (-\beta_I))$. The co-orientations of $k_0$ and $k_1$ are analogous.

	So for $j=0$, the co-orientation of the composition down then right is $$(\beta_W, \beta_W \wedge \beta_I) * (\beta_W \wedge \beta_I, \beta_M \wedge \beta_I) = (\beta_W, \beta_M \wedge \beta_I).$$
	The composition right then down is $$(\beta_W, \beta_M) * (\beta_M, \beta_M \wedge \beta_I) = (\beta_W , \beta_M \wedge \beta_I).$$
	So we have commutativity.
	When $j=1$, the computation is the same except that $\beta_I$ is replaced with $-\beta_I$ in both formulas.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{C: universal homotopy boundary co-orientation}
	Let $F \colon M \times I \to N$ be a co-oriented homotopy from $f$ to $g$ (see \cref{D: co-oriented homotopy}), and let $r_W \colon W \to M$ be a co-oriented map.
	Then $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I)$ is a co-oriented homotopy from $fr_W$ to $gr_W$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Again, the thing to check is the co-orientations. We continue to utilize the notation of the preceding lemma.

	By \cref{D: co-oriented homotopy}, the composition of the co-oriented boundary inclusion $k_0 \colon M = M \times 0 \into M \times I$ with $F$ is the co-oriented map $-f$, while the composition of the co-oriented boundary inclusion $k_1 \colon M = M \times 1 \into M \times I$ with $F$ is the co-oriented map
	$g$. On the other hand, the ``top and bottom'' components of the boundary of $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I)$ are the co-oriented compositions $F (r_W\times \id) i_0$ and $F (r_W\times \id) i_1$.
	But by the preceding lemma, for $j=0,1$, we have $F (r_W\times \id) i_j = F k_j r_W$.
	So when $j=0$, we have
	$$ F (r_W\times \id) i_0 = F k_0 r_W = -f r_W,$$
	and when $j=1$, we have
	$$ F (r_W\times \id) i_1 = F k_1 r_W = g r_W.$$

	So $F (r_W\times \id)$ is a co-oriented homotopy from $fr_W$ to $gr_W$ as desired.
\end{proof}

The next lemma shows that a homotopy $M \times I \to N$ of the above form cannot ``promote'' a manifold over $M$ that is in $Q(M)$ to one that is not in $Q(N)$.

\begin{lemma}\label{L: dessicated homotopy}
	Let $W \in PC_*^\Gamma(M)$ (or $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$).
	Let $F \colon M \times I \to N$ be a smooth homotopy; if $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ suppose further that $F$ is proper and co-oriented.
	Then $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I) \colon W \times I \to N$ is in $PC_*^\Gamma(N)$ (or $PC^*_\Gamma(N))$.
	Furthermore,
	if $r_W \colon W \to M$ is trivial, of small rank, or degenerate then so are
	$F \circ (r_W \times id_I) \colon W \times I \to N$ and $F(-,j) \circ r_W \colon W \to N$ for $j=0,1$ (for either co-orientation of $F(-,j)$, which is co-orientable by \cref{L: co-orientable homotopies}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The last statement concerning $F(-,j) \circ r_W \colon W \to N$ holds by \cref{L: Q preservation} and its proof.

	For	$F \circ (r_W \times id_I)$, we first suppose $W \in PC_*^\Gamma(M)$.
	In this case it is clear that $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I) \in PC_*^\Gamma(N)$ using the product orientation on $W \times I$.

	If $\rho \colon W \to W$ is an orientation-reversing diffeomorphism such that $r_W \circ \rho = r_W$, then
	$\rho \times \id_I \colon W \times I \to W \times I$ is an orientation-reversing self-diffeomorphism of $W \times I$ such that $F \circ (r_W \times id_I) \circ (\rho \times \id_I) = F \circ (r_W \times id_I)$.
	So $W \times I \to N$ is trivial.

	\begin{comment}
		% $F \circ (f \times id_I) \circ (\rho \times \id_I) = F \circ (f\rho \times \id_I) = F \circ (f \times \id _I)$.
	\end{comment}

	Next, if the derivative $Dr_W$ of the reference map $r_W$ has non-trivial kernel at a point $x \in W$ then so does the derivative $D(r_W \times \id_I)$ at each $(x,t) \in W \times I$, and thus so
	will $D(F \circ (r_W \times id_I)) = DF \circ D(r_W \times id_I)$.
	So $W \times I \to N$ has small rank if $r_W$ does.

	By definition, if $W \to M$ is degenerate then it has small rank and $\bd W = T \sqcup S$ with $T$ trivial and $S$ small rank.
	We have shown that $W \times I \xr{F\circ(r_W\times\id_I)} N$ then has small rank, so its suffices to consider its boundary,
	which is the union (up to signs) of $\bd W \times I$ and $W \times \bd I$.
	But $\bd W \times I = (T \times I) \sqcup (S \times I)$, which by our previous
	arguments are trivial and of small rank respectively.
	And the components of $W \times \bd I$ can be written for $j = 0, 1$ as $W \times j = W \xr{r_W} M \xr{F(-,j)} N$, and thus are of small rank since $r_W$ is.
	This completes the argument for $PC_*^\Gamma(M)$.

	If $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$, then $F$ is proper and co-oriented by assumption, and we noted above our co-orientation convention for $r_W \times \id_I$.
	To see the latter is proper, if $K$ is compact in $M \times I$, then $K \subset \pi_M(K) \times I$, which is also compact.
	Then $(r_W \times \id_I)^{-1}(K) \subset (r_W \times \id_I)^{-1}(\pi_M(K) \times I) = r_W^{-1}(\pi_M(K)) \times I$, which is compact as $r_W$ is proper.
	As compositions of proper co-oriented maps are proper and co-oriented, $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I) \colon W \times I \to N$ is well defined in $PC^*_\Gamma(N)$.
	The remaining arguments are analogous to the arguments above for $PC_*^\Gamma(M)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{C: chain homotopy}
	Let $V, W \in PC_i^\Gamma(M)$ or $V, W \in PC^i_\Gamma(M)$.
	Let $F \colon M \times I \to N$ be a smooth homotopy; if $V,W \in PC^i_\Gamma(M)$ suppose further that $F$ is proper and co-oriented.
	If $V,W$ represent the same element of $C_i^\Gamma(M)$ and $j=0,1$, then $F(-,j) \circ r_V: V \to N$ and	$F(-,j) \circ r_W \colon W \to N$ represent the same element of $C_i^\Gamma(N)$ (for either chosen co-orientation of $F(-,j)$) and $F \circ (r_V \times id_I) \colon V \times I \to N$ and $F \circ (r_W \times id_I) \colon W \times I \to N$ represent the same element of $C_{i+1}^\Gamma(M)$.
	The analogous fact holds for $V, W \in PC^i_\Gamma(M)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	We know $V, W \in PC_i^\Gamma(M)$ represent the same element of $C_i^\Gamma(M)$ if and only if $V \sqcup -W \in Q_*(M)$, so the corollary follows from \cref{L: dessicated homotopy}.
	Similarly for cochains.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{C: homotopy}
	Suppose $F \colon M \times I \to N$ is a smooth homotopy between maps $f,g \colon M \to N$.

	If $\uW \in C_*^\Gamma(M)$ is a cycle then $\underline{f(W)}$ and $\underline{g(W)}$ are homologous cycles in $N$.

	If $\uW \in C^*_\Gamma(M)$ is a cocycle and $F$ is proper and a co-oriented homotopy from $f$ to $g$ (see \cref{D: co-oriented homotopy}), then $\underline{f(W)}$ and $\underline{g(W)}$ are cohomologous cocycles in $N$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	By the preceding corollary we may work with any representative $r_W \colon W \to M$ of $\uW$.
	First suppose $W \in PC_*^\Gamma(M)$.
	Identifying $W \times I$ with $W \times_{pt} I$, by \cref{P: oriented fiber boundary} we have $\bd (W \times I) = \bd W \times I \bigsqcup (-1)^{w} W \times \bd I$.
	As $W$ is a cycle, $\bd W \in Q_*(M)$, and hence so is $F \circ ((\bd r_W) \times \id_I) \colon \bd W \times I \to N$ by the preceding lemma.
	Thus in $C^\Gamma_*(N)$ the boundary of $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I) \colon W \times I \to N$ is represented up to signs by the restriction of
	$F \circ (r_W \times \id_I)$ to $W \times \bd I = W \times (\{1\} \sqcup \{-0\})$, applying our conventions for the boundary of $I$ with its standard orientation.
	As $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I)|_{W \times 1} = gr_W$ and $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I)|_{W \times 0} = fr_W$, we see that up to the overall sign $(-1)^{w}$, the boundary of $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I)$ is represented in $C_*^\Gamma(N)$ by the disjoint union of $gr_W \colon W \to N$ and the negative of $fr_W \colon W \to N$.
	Thus $fr_W \colon W \to N$ and $gr_W \colon W \to N$ represent homologous cycles.

	Next consider the case of $W$ a cocycle. By \cref{C: universal homotopy boundary co-orientation,D: co-oriented homotopy}, $$\bd (F \circ (r_W \times \id_I)) = gr_W \amalg -fr_W \amalg H,$$ where $H$ is the homotopy $F \circ (r_W \times \id_I) \circ i_{\bd W \times \id_I} = F \circ (r_{\bd W} \times \id_I) \colon \bd W \times I \to N$.
	But $\bd W \in Q^*(M)$, and hence so is $H \colon (\bd W) \times I \to N$ by \cref{L: dessicated homotopy}.
	Thus we have
	that $fr_W \colon W \to N$ and $gr_W \colon W \to N$ represent cohomologous cocycles.
\end{proof}

We now come to the culmination of this section.
The first part of the following theorem is Lipyanskiy's Theorem 5 in \cite{Lipy14}.

\begin{theorem}\label{T: homology homotopy functor}
	Given a \textnormal{continuous} map $f \colon M \to N$ of manifolds without boundary\footnote{Possibly we can still let $M$ and $N$ be manifolds with corners and obtain a true statement, but we simplify our assumption here to avoid treating the question of smooth approximations in that setting.}, it induces a map $f_* \colon H_*^\Gamma(M) \to H_*^\Gamma(N)$ that depends only on the homotopy class of $f$.
	If $f$ is proper and co-oriented, it also induces $f_* \colon H^*_\Gamma(M) \to H^{*+n-m}_\Gamma(N)$, which depends only on the proper homotopy class and co-orientation of $f$.

	The constructions are both functorial.
	In other words:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $\id \colon M \to M$ is the identity map, then $\id_*$ is the identity map on $H_*^\Gamma(M)$ and $H^*_\Gamma(M)$, using the tautological co-orientation of $\id$ for the latter.
		\item If $f_1 \colon M \to N$ and $f_2 \colon N \to X$ are continuous maps of manifolds without boundary, then $(f_2f_1)_* = f_{2*}f_{1*} \colon H_*^\Gamma(M) \to H_*^\Gamma(X)$; if $f_1$ and $f_2$ are also co-oriented and proper, then $(f_2f_1)_* = f_{2*}f_{1*} \colon H^*_\Gamma(M) \to H^*_\Gamma(X)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	First consider the case of homology.
	Let $g$ be any smooth approximation to $f$.
	Then by \cref{C: homology chain map}, $g$ induces a chain map $C_*^\Gamma(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(N)$ and hence a map $H_*^\Gamma(M) \to H_*^\Gamma(N)$.
	We show that this map is independent of the choice of $g$.
	Let $h$ be any other smooth map homotopic to $f$ (and so also homotopic to $g$).
	The continuous homotopy from $g$ to $h$ can be smoothly approximated by a smooth homotopy $H \colon M \times I \to N$ from $g$ to $h$ \cite[Theorem III.2.5]{Kos93}.
	The cycles represented by $g(W)$ and $h(W)$ are homologous by \cref{C: homotopy}.


	The cohomological case is the same by taking proper smooth approximations, which we show can be found in the proof of \cref{T: basic trans}, and co-orienting the homotopies using \cref{L: co-orientable homotopies} so that the approximations $g$ and $h$ are co-oriented homotopic to $f$.

	The functoriality is clear after replacing both $f_1$ and $f_2$ by (proper) smooth approximations.
\end{proof}

If $f \colon M \to N$ as above, we will often abuse notation by writing simply $f$ to denote the map on geometric chains or geometric homology, rather than $f_*$.

With functoriality of geometric homology established, we can introduce reduced homology; cf.\ \cite[page 200]{Span81}.

\begin{definition}\label{D: reduced}
The \textbf{reduced geometric homology} $\td H_*^\Gamma(M)$ of the manifold without corners $M$ is defined to be the kernel of the homomorphism $H_*^\Gamma(M) \to H_*^\Gamma(pt)$ induced by the unique map of $M$ to a point.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{R: reduced h}
Given the observations of \cref{E: first examples} and the splitting of surjective maps to free modules, we have the standard facts that $\td H_i^\Gamma(M) = H_i^\Gamma(M)$ when $i \neq 0$, while $$H_0^\Gamma(M) \cong \td H_0^\Gamma(M) \oplus H_0^\Gamma(pt) \cong \td H_0^\Gamma(M) \oplus \Z.$$

As for reduced singular homology, generators of $\td H_0^\Gamma(M)$ can be represented by prechains consisting of pairs of points with opposite orientations in separate components of $M$, as if they were in the same component then we could connect them with a path and they would represent $0$ in $\td H_0^\Gamma(M)$.

We recall that $M$ must have at most a countable number of components by the footnote on page \pageref{F: countable}, so let us write $M = \amalg M_i$ for connected components $M_i$ of $M$.
Then if $g_{ij}$, $i \neq j$, is a homology class represented by a prechain with a negative point in component $M_i$ and a positive point in component $M_j$, then we also have the relations $g_{ij}+g_{jk}=g_{ik}$.
So $\td H_0^\Gamma(M)$ can be identified with either the free abelian group on generators $g_{1i}$, $i>1$, or on generators $g_{i,i+1}$ for $i \geq 1$ so long as $i+1$ exists as an index.
\end{remark}

We can also now establish the standard additivity property.

\begin{proposition}\label{P: additive h}
Let $M = \amalg{M_a}$, and let $i_a \colon M_a \into M$ be the inclusion.
Define $i \colon \oplus H_*^\Gamma(M_a) \to H_*^\Gamma(M)$ by $i(\oplus \underline{V_a}) = \sum i_a(\underline{V_a})$.
Then $i$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Note that we have written an element of $\oplus H_*^\Gamma(M_a)$ as $\oplus \underline{V_a}$, but to be an element of $\oplus H_*^\Gamma(M_a)$, we tacitly assume that all but a finite number of classes $\underline{V_a}$ are trivial.
The map $i$ is then well defined.

Suppose $\uW \in  H_*^\Gamma(M)$ is represented by $r_W \colon W \to M$.
Let $W_a$ be the union of those components of $W$ that map to $M_a$, and let $r_{W_a} \colon W_a \to M_a$ be defined by restricting the codomain of $r_W|_{W_a}$.
As $W$ is compact, there must be a finite number of indices $a$ such that $W_a$ is non-empty.
Each $W_a$ represents a geometric cycle in $M_a$, else $W$ could not represent a cycle in $W$, and $i(\oplus \underline{W_a}) = \uW$, so $i$ is surjective.

Next, suppose $i(\oplus \underline{V_a})=0$ with $V_a \in PC_*^\Gamma(M_a)$ representing $\underline{V_a}$.
By \cref{R: cycles and boundaries}, there is a $W \in PC_*^\Gamma(M)$ such that $\bd W \sqcup (\sqcup_a -V_a) \in Q_*(M)$.
Let $W_a$ be as above.
Then we must have $\bd W_a \sqcup -V_a \in Q_*(M_a)$, which implies that $\underline{V_a}$ represents $0$ in $H_*^\Gamma(M_a)$.
So $i$ is injective.
\end{proof}

There is another very useful application of \cref{C: homotopy} that will be needed frequently below.
To explain, we first observe that if we have a map $r_W \colon W \to M$ representing an element of $H_*^\Gamma(M)$, then, in general, this homology class is not preserved under homotopies of $r_W$.
For example, a map representing a cycle might be homotopic to maps that do not represent cycles by pulling apart cancelling boundary components during the homotopy, or maps of small rank may be homotopic to maps that do not have small rank.
So, in general, geometric homology and cohomology do not behave well with respect to homotopies of the elements of $PC(M)$; this is the case also with ordinary singular chains modeled on simplices.
This will cause difficulties below, for example when we want to alter a map representing a cycle by a homotopy to make it transverse to some other cycle.
The solution will be to define and use what we call universal homotopies.

\begin{definition}\label{D: universal homotopy}
	Given two maps $f,g \colon W\to M$, we say that there is a \textbf{universal homotopy} from $f$ to $g$ if there is a smooth homotopy $H \colon M\times I\to M$ with $H(-,0)=\id_M$ and such that $g=H(-,1)\circ f$; in other words, if $f$ and $g$ are homotopic by a composition of the form $W \times I \xr{f\times \id} M \times I \xr{H} M$ with $H(-,0)$ the identity. In this case, we call the composition a \textbf{universal homotopy} from $f$ to $g$. We say that the universal homotopy is proper if $f$, $g$, and $H$ are proper maps.
\end{definition}

If one thinks of an ordinary homotopy from $f$ to $g$ as a way of obtaining $g$ by deforming $f$, then we think of a universal homotopy as deforming $f$ by first performing $f$ and then deforming $M$.


\begin{proposition}\label{P: universal homotopy}
	Suppose there is a universal homotopy from $f \colon W\to M$ to $g \colon W\to M$. If $f \colon W\to M$ represents an element of $H_*^\Gamma(M)$, then $g = H(-,1)f \colon W\to M$ represents the same element. Similarly, if $f \colon W\to M$ represents an element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$ and the universal homotopy is proper, then $g \colon W\to M$ represents the same element.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	The proposition is immediate from \cref{C: homotopy}, taking $M=N$ there and letting $F$ be the map $H \colon M \times I \to M$ of \cref {D: universal homotopy} that realizes the universal homotopy. In the case of cohomology, we co-orient $H$ using the co-orientation induced by the tautological co-orientation of $H(-,0) = \id \colon M \to M$; see \cref{D: homotopy co-orientation}.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Contravariant functoriality of geometric homology and cohomology}\label{S: cohomology pullback}

In this section, we assign to a continuous map $f \colon M \to N$ of manifolds without boundary a map $H^*_\Gamma(N) \to H^*_\Gamma(M)$.
If $f$ is proper and $M$ and $N$ are oriented, we also have a map $f^* \colon H_*^\Gamma(N) \to H_{*+m-n}^\Gamma(M)$.
As in the preceding section, we first consider a smooth map $f$ and then generalize to the continuous case using smooth approximations.
For simplicity of notation in what follows, we will not always explicitly write the degree shift for the homology map.

First, suppose $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(N)$ is represented by a proper co-oriented map $r_W \colon W \to N$, and let $g \colon M \to N$ be a \textit{smooth} map such that $g$ is transverse to $r_W$.
We emphasize that there is no need for assumptions that $g$ be co-oriented or proper.
We define $g^*(W)$ to be the pullback $r_W \times_N g \colon W \times_N M \to M$, co-oriented by our standard convention from \cref{D: pullback coorient}.
The pullback is proper by \cref{L: co-orientable pullback}.
Also, using our standard convention for notating dimensions, the pullback has dimension $w+m-n$, and we have $m - (w+m-n) = n - w$. In other words, the index of $W$ as a precochain of $N$ is the same as the index of $W \times_N M$ as a precochain of $M$.
So, when defined, $g^*$ takes elements of $PC_\Gamma^i(N)$ to elements of $PC_\Gamma^i(M)$.

Similarly, if $W \in PC_*^\Gamma(N)$ and $g \colon M \to N$ is smooth and transverse to $r_W$ and if $M$ and $N$ are oriented, the pullback $W \times_N M$ has the pullback orientation of \cref{S: orientation of fiber products} and maps to $M$ by projection.
Furthermore, if $g$ is proper, then $W \times_N M$ is compact, as we show in the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{L: compact pullback}
	Suppose $g \colon M \to N$ is a proper map from a manifold with corners to a manifold without boundary.
	Suppose $W$ is a compact manifold with corners and that $r_W \colon W \to N$ is transverse to $g$.
	Then $W \times_N M$ is compact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	As $W$ is compact, so is $r_W(W)$, and as $g$ is proper, $g^{-1}(r_W(W))$ is compact.
	Now we observe that we must have $W \times_N M \subset W \times g^{-1}(r_W(W)) \subset W \times M$.
	So $W \times_N M$ is compact.
\end{proof}

The following lemma is similar to \cref{L: pullback with Q}, as is its proof, though there the focus was on fiber products, not pullbacks.
It will be useful later to allow $M$ to be a manifold with corners here.

\begin{comment}
	\red{GBF: Might want to try to combine those into a single lemma somewhere at some point, but it looks like it might be less messy, if a bit redundant, not to.}
\end{comment}

\begin{lemma}\label{L: pullback map Q}
	Suppose $M$ is a manifold with corners and $N$ is a manifold without boundary.
	Suppose $r_S \colon S \to N$ is trivial (oriented or co-oriented) or has small rank, and let $g \colon M \to N$ be a smooth map transverse to $r_S$.
	Then the pullback $g^*(S) = S \times_N M \to M$ is also trivial or has small rank, respectively.
	Consequently, if $S \in Q(N)$ then $S \times_N M \to M$ is in $Q(M)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	If $\rho$ is a (co\nobreakdash-)orientation reversing diffeomorphism of $S$ over $N$, then the restriction of $\rho \times \id_M$ to $S \times_N M \subset S \times M$ is a (co\nobreakdash-)orientation reversing diffeomorphism of $S \times_N M$ over $M$ by \cref{L: product preserves iso}.

	Next, suppose $r_S \colon S \to N$ has small rank.
	Suppose at the point $x \in S$ we have $v \in \ker(D_x r_S)$.
	By \cref{L: tangent of pullbacks}, if $(x,y) \in S \times M$, the tangent space $T_{(x,y)}(S \times_N M)$ is the pullback $T_xS\times_{T_{(r_S(x),g(y))}N} T_y M$, and we are interested in the map from this space under the derivative of the projection $\pi \colon S \times M \to M$.
	As $v \in \ker (D_xr_S)$, we have $(v,0) \in T_{(x,y)}(S \times_N M)$, and this projects to $0$ in $T_yM$.
	So $(v,0) \in \ker(D_{(x,y)}\pi)$.
	This shows that the pullback has small rank.

	The final statement is then a consequence of the definitions as in the proof of \cref{L: Q preservation}.
\end{proof}

The requirement that $g \colon M \to N$ must be transverse to $W$ means that even with the preceding lemmas we cannot define chain maps $g^* \colon C^*_\Gamma(N) \to C^*_\Gamma(M)$ or $g^* \colon C_*^\Gamma(N) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$ because for any fixed $g$ there may be geometric cochains none of whose representatives are transverse to $g$.
Nonetheless, given any continuous $f \colon M \to N$ of manifolds without boundary we can define a map in geometric cohomology $f^* \colon H^*_\Gamma(N) \to H^*_\Gamma(M)$, and if $M$ and $N$ are oriented and $f$ is proper, we can further define a map in geometric homology $f^* \colon H_*^\Gamma(N) \to H_{*+m-n}^\Gamma(M)$.
The constructions are as follows.

\begin{definition}\label{D: cohomology pullback and homology transfer}
	Suppose $f \colon M \to N$ is a continuous (not necessarily smooth, co-oriented, or proper) map of manifolds without boundary and $\uW \in H^*_\Gamma(N)$ is represented by $r_W \colon W \to N$.
	Let $g \colon M \to N$ be any smooth map homotopic to $f$ that is transverse to $r_W$ (which we know exists by \cref{T: basic trans}).
	Then we define $f^*(\uW) \in H^*_\Gamma(M)$ as the cohomology class represented by the pullback of $W$ by $g$, i.e.\ $g^*(W) = W \times_N M \to M$.

	If also $M$ and $N$ are oriented and $f$ is proper, and if $\uW \in H_*^\Gamma(N)$ is represented by $r_W \colon W \to N$, then let $g$ be a smooth proper map properly homotopic to $f$ and transverse to $r_W$ (also by \cref{T: basic trans}).
	Then we define $f^*(\uW) \in H_*^\Gamma(M)$ as the homology class represented by the pullback of $W$ by $g$, i.e.\ $g^*(W) = W \times_N M \to M$, with the pullback oriented as in \cref{S: orientation of fiber products}.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{P: cohomology pullback}
	Suppose $f \colon M \to N$ is a continuous (not necessarily smooth, co-oriented, or proper) map of manifolds without boundary.
	The map $f^* \colon H^k_\Gamma(N) \to H^k_\Gamma(M)$ is well defined and depends only on the homotopy class of $f$.
	Similarly, if $M$ is oriented and $f$ is proper, then the map $f_* \colon H_k^\Gamma(N) \to H_{k+m-n}^\Gamma(M)$ is well defined and depends only on the proper homotopy class of $f$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	We treat only the cohomology case, as the homology arguments are analogous taking the appropriate maps and homotopies to be proper, which is consistent with our applications of \cref{T: basic trans,T: homotopy trans} below.

	First, let $r_W \colon W \to N$ represent a cocycle, and suppose $g_0 \colon M \to N$ is smooth, homotopic to $f$, and transverse to $r_W$.
	By \cref{D: cohomology pullback and homology transfer}, $f^*(\uW)$ is represented by the pullback $g^*(W) = W \times_N M \to M$.
	We first observe this represents a cocycle.
	Because $M$ is without boundary, we have by \cref{leibniz} that $\bd(W\times_N M) = (\bd W) \times_N M$.
	Then as $\bd W \in Q^*(N)$ by assumption, we have $(\bd W) \times_N M \in Q^*(M)$ by \cref{L: pullback map Q}.
	Hence $g^*(W) = W \times_N M \to M$ represents a cocycle.

	Next suppose we have two maps $g_0, g_1 \colon M \to N$ that are smooth, homotopic to $f$, and transverse to $r_W$.
	Let $G'$ be a smooth homotopy from $g_0$ to $g_1$, which exists by \cite[Proposition 9.2.33]{MaDo92} (or, if $f$ is proper and $g_0$ and $g_1$ are smooth proper maps properly homotopic to $f$, there is a smooth proper such $G'$ by \cite[Proposition 9.2.35]{MaDo92}).
	Then by \cref{T: homotopy trans} there exists a smooth homotopy $G \colon M \times I \to N$ from $g_0$ to $g_1$ such that $G$ is transverse to $r_W$.
	In particular, we apply \cref{T: homotopy trans} with the map $f$ of that theorem being our smooth homotopy $G'$, whose boundary consists of $g_0$ and $g_1$; then the resulting map $h(-,1)$ of that theorem will be our desired $G$.

	Now, consider the composition $W \times_N (M \times I) \xr{r_W \times_N G} M \times I \to M$ of the pullback of $r_W$ by $G$ and the projection $M \times I \to M$.
	As $r_W$ is proper and co-oriented, so is the pullback, and the projection $M \times I \to M$ has its standard co-orientation $(\beta_M \wedge \beta_I,\beta_M)$ and is proper.
	So this composition represents a geometric cochain in $M$.
	Furthermore, the boundary of this composition is the disjoint union of $\bd W \times_N (M \times I) \to M \times I \to M$ and, up to sign, $$W \times_N \bd(M \times I) = \left( W \times_N (M \times \{1\})\right) \sqcup \left(- W \times_N (M \times \{0\})\right) \to M \times I \to M$$ as $M$ is a manifold without boundary.
	Since $W$ is assumed to be a cocycle, $\bd W \in Q^*(N)$.
	So $\bd W \times_N (M \times I) \to M \times I$ is in\footnote{Note that even if $M$ is without boundary, $M \times I$ will have boundary (unless $M$ is empty).
	This instance is the main reason we have allowed such constructions as $PC^*(-)$ and $Q^*(-)$ to take manifolds with non-empty boundary as inputs up to this point.
	In this particular case, since $N$ does not have boundary, all of our ``smooth'' maps to $N$ are automatically smooth in the strong sense of \cite{Joy12}, as are then $W \times_N (M \times I) \to M \times I$ and $M \times I = M \times_{pt} I \to M$ as these are both pullbacks in the smooth category.}
	$Q^*(M \times I)$ by \cref{L: pullback map Q}, and then by the proof of \cref{L: Q preservation} the projection to $M$ preserves triviality and small rank.
	Therefore, the composite $\bd W \times_N (M \times I) \to M \times I \to M$ is in $Q^*(M)$.
	The other terms correspond to the pullbacks of $W$ via $g_0$ and $g_1$, so $g_0^*(W)$ and $g_1^*(W)$ represent cohomologous cocycles.

	Finally, as we have noted that $f^*$ is not a fully-defined chain map, we must show directly that $f^*$ as a cohomology map does not depend on the choice of precocycle representing a cohomology class.
	So suppose $r_{W_0} \colon W_0 \to N$ and $r_{W_1} \colon W_1 \to N$ represent the same cohomology class.
	In this case there will be a $Z \in PC^*_\Gamma(N)$ such that $\bd \underline{Z} = \underline{W_0} - \underline{W_1}.$
	As $\bd \underline{Z} = \underline{\bd Z}$ and $\underline{W_0} - \underline{W_1} = \underline{W_0 \sqcup - W_1}$ by \cref{D: chains and cochains,L: co/chains well defined}, the above equality means by \cref{L: co/chains well defined} that $\bd Z \sqcup -(W_0 \sqcup -W_1) \in Q^*(N)$.
	By \cref{T: basic trans} and its proof, we may choose a smooth $g$ homotopic to $f$ that is transverse to all of $Z$ (and so also $\bd Z$), $W_0$, and $W_1$.
	Then by \cref{L: pullback map Q}, the pullback by $g$ given by
	$$\left[\bd Z \sqcup -(W_0 \sqcup -W_1)\right] \times_N M = ((\bd Z) \times_N M) \sqcup (-W_0 \times_N M) \sqcup (W_1 \times_N M)$$
	is in $Q^*(M)$.
	As $M$ has no boundary, $(\bd Z) \times_N M = \bd (Z \times_N M)$.
	It follows that $$\bd \underline{(Z \times_N M)} = \underline{(W_0 \times_N M)} \sqcup \underline{(-W_1 \times_N M)}.$$
	So $W_0 \times_N M$ and $W_1 \times_N M$ represent cohomologous cocycles, and $f^*$ does not depend on the choice of representing precocycle.

	Thus $f^*$ does not depend on our choices and depends on $f$ only through its homotopy class.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{C: contra funct}
	The assignment taking $f$ to $f^*$ is functorial.
	In other words:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item If $\id \colon M \to M$ is the identity map, then $\id^*$ is the identity map on $H^*_\Gamma(M)$; if $M$ is also oriented, then $\id^*$ is the identity map on $H_*^\Gamma(M)$.
			\item If $f_1 \colon M \to N$ and $f_2 \colon N \to X$ are continuous maps of manifolds without boundary, then $(f_2f_1)^* = f_1^*f_2^* \colon H^*_\Gamma(X) \to H^*_\Gamma(M)$; if $f_1$ and $f_2$ are also proper maps and $M$, $N$, and $X$ are oriented, then $(f_2f_1)^* = f_1^*f_2^* \colon H_*^\Gamma(X) \to H_*^\Gamma(M)$.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	We first consider cohomology.
	In this case, both statements follow from \cref{P: pullback functoriality}.
	For the second statement, given a cocycle represented by $r_W \colon W \to X$, we first apply \cref{T: basic trans} to obtain a smooth approximation $g_2$ to $f_2$ that is transverse to $r_W$ and then again to obtain a smooth approximation $g_1$ to $f_1$ that is transverse to the pullback $W \times_X N \to N$.

	For the homology case, we create the pullbacks the same way using that \cref{T: basic trans} allows us to approximate proper maps by proper maps.
	The properties then follow from \cref{P: oriented fiber product basic properties} and \cref{P: oriented fiber mixed associativity}, in the latter case taking the map labeled $g$ in the statement of that proposition to be the identity.
\end{proof}


\begin{comment}
\begin{remark}\label{R: homology transfer}
	Analogously, given $f \colon M \to N$, one could also define a contravariant pullback functor of homology groups $f^*: H_*^\Gamma(N) \to H_*^\Gamma(M)$ if $f$ is proper and $M$ and $N$ are both oriented (so that the pullback can be oriented).
	The following lemma shows that the pullback of a compact map by a proper map is compact.
	For the orientation, we observe that given an oriented map $r_V \colon V \to N$ that represents $\uV$ and a map $g \colon M \to N$ that is properly homotopic to $f$ and transverse to $r_V$, the orientations of $V$ and $N$ induce a co-orientation on $r_V$ and so a co-orientation on the pullback $V \times_N M \to M$ by \cref{D: pullback coorient}.
	This in turn induces an orientation on $V \times_N M$ given the orientation of $M$.
\end{remark}
\end{comment}


\begin{example}\label{E: contractible}
By \cref{E: dimension}, $H^i_\Gamma(pt)=0$ for $i\neq 0$, while it follows from \cref{E: first examples} and \cref{T: PD} that  $H^0_\Gamma(pt) \cong \Z$, generated by the class of the identity $pt \to pt$ with either co-orientation.
It follows now from the homotopy functoriality of pullbacks that if $D$ is any contractible manifold then similarly $H^i_\Gamma(D)=0$ for $i\neq 0$ and $H^0_\Gamma(D) \cong \Z$.
The representatives of generators of $H^0_\Gamma(D)$ are the pullbacks of the generators of $H^0_\Gamma(pt)$ by the homotopy equivalence $D \to pt$.
These are the identity maps $\id \colon D \to D$ with either co-orientation.

Next consider the projection $M \times D \to M$, which is a homotopy equivalence for any manifold $M$ and any contractible manifold $D$.
Then $H^i_\Gamma(M \times D) \cong H^i_\Gamma(M)$, and if $r_W \colon W \to M$ (with some co-orientation) represents a cohomology class in $H^i_\Gamma(M)$, the corresponding class in $H^i_\Gamma(M \times D)$ is represented by the map $W \times D \to M \times D$ given by $(w,d) \mapsto (r_W(w),d)$, with its pullback co-orientation.
\end{example}

The functoriality of geometric cohomology allows us to establish the standard additivity property for cohomology.
The argument is analogous to that for \cref{P: additive h}.

\begin{proposition}\label{P: additive c}
Let $M = \amalg{M_a}$, and let $i_a \colon M_a \into M$ be the inclusion.
Define $i^* \colon H^*_\Gamma(M) \to \prod_a H^*_\Gamma(M_a)$ by $i^*(\uV) = \prod i^*_a(\uV)$.
Then $i^*$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We observe that if $r_V \colon V \to M$ represents a cochain, then $i^*_a(\uV)$ is simply the restriction of $r_V$ to those connected components of $V$ that map to $M_a$, which we write as $r_{V_a} \colon V_a \to M_a$.


So first consider $\prod_a \underline{W_a} \in \prod_a H^*_\Gamma(M_a)$ with each $\underline{W_a}$ represented by $r_{W_a} \colon W_a \to M_a$.
As noted in the footnote on page \pageref{F: countable}, $M$ and each representative precochain $W_a$ must have a countable number of components, and so $W = \sqcup W_a$ can be embedded in $\R^\infty$.
We define $r_W \colon W \to M$ by letting $r_W = r_{W_a}$ on $W_a$, and $r_W$ is proper since it maps properly to each $M_a$.
Then $i^*(\uW) = \prod i^*_a(\uW) = \prod \underline{W_a}$.
So $i^*$ is surjective.

Next, suppose $i^*(\uV) = 0$.
Let $V \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ represent $\uV$, and let $V_a$ be the union of those connected components of $V$ that map to $M_a$.
By \cref{R: cycles and boundaries}, there are $W_a \in PC^*_\Gamma(M_a)$ such that $\bd W_a \sqcup -V_a \in Q^*(M_a)$.
We let $W = \sqcup W_a$ as above, and it follows that $(\sqcup_a \bd W_a) \sqcup (\sqcup -V_a) = W \sqcup -V \in Q^*(M)$.
So $V$ represents $0$ in $H^*_\Gamma(M)$, and $i^*$ is injective.
\end{proof}


We can now discuss reduced cohomology; cf.\ \cite[page 240]{Span81}.

\begin{definition}\label{D: reduced c}
The \textbf{reduced geometric cohomology} $\td H^*_\Gamma(M)$ of the manifold without corners $M$ is defined to be the cokernel of the homomorphism $H^*_\Gamma(pt)\to H^*_\Gamma(M)$ induced by the unique map of $M$ to a point.

As $H^i_\Gamma(pt) = 0$ for $i \neq 0$, we have the standard fact that  $\td H^i_\Gamma(M) = H^i_\Gamma(M)$ for $i \neq 0$.
When $i=0$, the generator of $H^0_\Gamma(pt) \cong \Z$, which is represented by the identity map of the point, maps to the class of $H^0_\Gamma(M)$ represented by the pullback of identity map of the point, which is the identity map of $M$ with its tautological co-orientation.
As noted in \cref{E: first examples}, we will show below that when $M$ is connected this map generates $H^0_\Gamma(M) \cong \Z$.
So by \cref{P: additive c}, we have $H^0_\Gamma(M) \cong \prod \Z$, where the product is indexed over the components of $M$ with each factor generated by the identity map of that component with its tautological co-orientation.
Then $\td H^0_\Gamma(M)$ is the quotient of this $\prod \Z$ by the subgroup generated by $(1,1,\ldots)$.
\end{definition}



\subsection{Mayer--Vietoris sequences}\label{S: MV}

In this section, we consider Mayer--Vietoris sequences for homology and cohomology.
In particular, we present covariant homology and cohomology sequences and a contravariant cohomology sequence.

Throughout our treatment, we will assume that $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of a manifold without boundary $M$.
Note that any of $U$, $V$, or $U \cap V$ may be empty.

For the covariant homology sequence, the maps $H_*^\Gamma(U) \to H_*^\Gamma(M)$, etc., induced by inclusion will be those defined in \cref{S: covariant functoriality}.
For a covariant cohomology sequence, however, the maps of the preceding section will not work, as the inclusion of an open set into a manifold is not generally proper.
Rather, to obtain a covariant cohomology sequence we will need to use in at least some of the terms a variant of geometric cohomology supported on open subsets, denoted $H^*_\Gamma(M|_U)$.
We will not provide an in-depth study of this variant cohomology, but it will not take us too far afield to introduce it here and treat its Mayer--Vietoris sequence in parallel with the homology sequence.
We justify this added effort by observing that we will have $H^*_\Gamma(M|_M) = H^*_\Gamma(M)$, so this sequence may be useful in studying our usual geometric cohomology.
However, the reader more interested in our standard geometric homology and cohomology can bypass this next section and go right to the following section.


\subsubsection{Cohomology supported on open sets}

In this brief section we provide the definition and some immediate properties for cohomology supported on open sets.

\begin{definition}
	Let $M$ be a manifold without boundary and $U \subset M$ an open subset.
	Define $C_\Gamma^*(M|_U) \subset C_\Gamma^*(M)$ to be the subcomplex consisting of elements of $C_\Gamma^*(M)$ that can be represented by $r_W \colon W \to M$ in $PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ with the image of $W$ contained in $U$.
	Let $H_\Gamma^*(M|_U) = H^*(C_\Gamma^*(M|_U))$.
\end{definition}

It is easy to observe that $C_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$ is a chain complex as it is closed under addition and taking boundaries using that the sum $\underline{W_1}+\underline{W_2}$ of two elements of $C^*_\Gamma(M|_U)$ represented by elements of $PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ with image in $U$ can be represented by the disjoint union $W_1 \sqcup W_2$ with image in $U$, and similarly the boundary of a precochain with image in $U$ has image in $U$.

In fact, we can reformulate this definition as follows.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $PC_\Gamma^*(M|_U) \subset PC_\Gamma^*(M)$ be the subset consisting of $r_W \colon W \to M$ with image in $U$, and let $Q^*(M|_U)$ be the elements of $Q^*(M)$ with image in $U$.
	Then $C_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$ is isomorphic to the set of equivalence classes of $PC_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$ under the relation $V\sim_U W$ if $V \sqcup -W \in Q^*(M|_U)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We first observe that $\sim_U$ is an equivalence relation on $PC_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$ by the same proof as \cref{L: cancel Q}, assuming all maps have image in $U$.
	Furthermore, if $V,W \in PC_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$ and $V\sim_UW$ then $V\sim W$ in the sense of \cref{L: cancel Q}.
	So letting $\hat C_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$ temporarily denote the
	equivalence classes under $\sim_U$, we have a well-defined map $f \colon \hat C_\Gamma^*(M|_U) \to C_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$.
	By definition, elements of $C_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$ can be represented by elements of $PC_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$, so $f$ is surjective.
	Now suppose $W_1,W_2 \in PC^*_\Gamma(M|_U)$ represent the same element of $C^*_\Gamma(M|_U)$.
	Then $W_1\sim W_2$ in the sense of \cref{L: cancel Q}, i.e.\ $W_1 \sqcup -W_2 \in Q^*(M)$, but $W_1$ and $W_2$ each have support in $U$, so $W_1 \sqcup -W_2 \in Q^*(M|_U)$ and $W_1\sim_U W_2$.
	So $f$ is injective.
\end{proof}

The cohomology groups $H_\Gamma^*(M|_U)$ are functorial in the sense that if $U \subset W \subset M$ are open sets then we have $C_\Gamma^*(M|_U) \subset C_\Gamma^*(M|_W) \subset C_\Gamma^*(M|_M) = C_\Gamma^*(M)$, and these induce maps $H_\Gamma^*(M|_U) \to H_\Gamma^*(M|_W) \to H_\Gamma^*(M)$.


As Mayer--Vietoris sequences are often the engines of induction arguments and as many inductions start with Euclidean balls, we provide the following computation, which is akin to the dimension axiom or the Poincar\'e lemma; see \cref{E: dimension}.

\begin{proposition}\label{P: P lemma}
	Let $M$ be an $m$-dimensional smooth manifold, and $U \subset M$ an open set that is diffeomorphic to an open ball and whose closure in $M$ is compact.
	Then $H^n_\Gamma(M|_U)$ is $\Z$ if $n = m$ and is zero otherwise.
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{P: P lemma}]
	If $r_W \colon W \to M$ is proper and has image in $U$, then $W$, as the preimage of the closure of $U$, must be compact.
	Also, $U$ is orientable, and so by choosing an orientation of $U$ every co-oriented $r_W \colon W \to U$ determines an orientation of $W$ as explained in \cref{S: co-orientations}.
	Thus $C^*_\Gamma(M|_U) \cong C_{m-*}^\Gamma(U)$, and the result follows from \cref{E: dimension} (the dimension axiom), homotopy functoriality of geometric homology, and that $U$ is homotopy equivalent to a point.
\end{proof}



\subsubsection{Covariant Mayer--Vietoris sequences}

We now turn to our covariant Mayer--Vietoris sequences.


A key tool in proving the existence of these sequences will be creasing, which we introduced in \cref{S: creasing}.
For geometric homology and cohomology, creasing replaces the role that subdivision plays in the classical singular theories.
In some sense creasing is simpler, as creasing only needs to be applied once while subdivision often needs to be iterated.
In order to perform creasing, the following definitions will be useful.

\begin{definition}\label{D: separating function}
	Let $U,V$ be open subsets of a manifold $M$.
	We will call a smooth function $\phi \colon U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$ a \textbf{separating function for $\mathbf U$ and $\mathbf V$} if $U - V \subset \phi^{-1}(-1/2)$ and $V - U \subset \phi^{-1}(1/2)$.
	As $U  - V$ and $V  - U$ are disjoint closed subsets of $U \cup V$ and all of our spaces are normal by assumption, such a function can always be found by an application of Urysohn's Lemma to find a continuous function with this property and then applying the Smooth Approximation Theorem \cite[Theorem III.2.5]{Kos93}.
	We use $\pm 1/2$ as our endpoints to be consistent with the maps $\phi \colon M \to (-1,1)$ used in the definition of creasing.
	Note that we only assume that $U  - V \subset \phi^{-1}(-1/2)$ and not that $U  - V = \phi^{-1}(-1/2)$, and similarly for $V  - U$.
	However, it will be useful to keep in mind that $\phi^{-1}([-1/2,1/2)) \subset U$ and $\phi^{-1}((-1/2,1/2]) \subset V$.

	Suppose now $\phi$ is a separating function for $U$ and $V$ and that we have a map $r_W \colon W \to U \cup V$.
	We will say that $\phi$ \textbf{separates $\mathbf W$ over $\mathbf U$ and $\mathbf V$} if $0$ is a regular value for $\phi$ and for the composite $\phi r_W$, meaning that $\phi$ and $\phi r_W$ are transverse to the inclusion of $0$ into $[-1/2,1/2]$.
	In particular, $0$ is a regular value in the usual sense for the restriction of $\phi r_W$ to each stratum of $W$.
	Consequently, if $\phi$ is separating for $W$ over $U$ and $V$, we may perform creasing of $W$ along $(\phi r_W)^{-1}(0)$ as defined in \cref{S: creasing}.
	More generally, we can form $W^+$, $W^-$, and $W^0$ as discussed in \cref{E: manifold decomposition,S: codim 0 and 1 co-or}.
	Note that some of these spaces may be empty depending on the configuration of $U$ and $V$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{L: existence of separating}
	Given $U,V \subset M$ as above and $r_W \colon W \to U \cup V$.
	There exists a function separating $W$ over $U$ and $V$.
	More generally, for any countable collection $r_{W_i} \colon W_i \to U \cup V$, there is a $\phi$ that is separating for all $W_i$ over $U$ and $V$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\phi$ be a separating function for $U$ and $V$; we have already observed these exist.
	By Sard's Theorem, when $M$ is any smooth manifold without boundary the set of regular values of $\phi \colon M \to [-1/2,1/2]$ is a set whose complement has measure zero.
	So for any countable set of maps $W_j \to U \cup V$ from smooth manifolds without boundary we can find a value $p \in (-1/2, 1/2)$ that is a regular value for $\phi$ and for all $\phi r_{W_j}$, as a countable union of sets of measure zero still has measure $0$.
	In particular, we can take the $W_j$ to be the strata of a single manifold with corners or even all the strata of a countable collection of manifolds with corners.
 Once we have found such a common regular value $p$, we can then replace $\phi$ by its composition with an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of $[-1/2,1/2]$ that takes $p$ to $0$, for example the linear fractional transformation $x \mapsto \frac{x-p}{-4px+1}$.
	This composition is our desired function.
\end{proof}


We are now ready to demonstrate the existence of covariant Mayer--Vietoris sequences.
In the following statements, we let $i_U \colon U \cap V \to U$ and $i_V \colon U \cap V \to V$ be the inclusion maps, and we write $(i_U, -i_V)$ for the map $C_*^{\Gamma}(U \cap V) \to C_*^{\Gamma}(U) \oplus C_*^{\Gamma}(V)$ that takes $\uW$ to $(i_U(\uW), -i_V(\uW))$.
More generally, we use the notation $(a,b)$ for elements of a direct sum.


\begin{theorem}\label{T: relative MV}
	Let $M$ be a manifold without boundary.
	For any pair of open sets $U$ and $V$ in $M$ there are Mayer--Vietoris exact sequences

		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	The proof parallels standard proofs of the existence of Mayer--Vietoris sequences for singular homology.
	The proofs for homology and cohomology are analogous, so we give the cohomological case, which is slightly more exotic.

	Let $S^*$ denote the quotient of $C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_U) \oplus C_{\Gamma}^{*}(M|_V)$ by the image of $C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U \cap V})$ under the map $(i_U, -i_V)$, with $i_U$ and $i_V$ being the inclusions.
	Then we have a short exact sequence
	\begin{equation}\label{E: homology MV SES}
		\begin{tikzcd}[
			column sep = small,
			arrow style = math font,
			cells = {nodes = {text height = 2ex,text depth = 0.75ex}}

			C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_U) \oplus C_{\Gamma}^{*}(M|_V) \arrow[r] &
			S^* \arrow[r] &
			0.
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation}
	This short exact sequence generates a long exact cohomology sequence, and the theorem will follow from showing there is a quasi-isomorphism $\psi \colon S^* \to C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U \cup V})$.
	Our quasi-isomorphism will be induced by the map $C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_U) \oplus C_{\Gamma}^{*}(M|_V) \to C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U \cup V})$ that takes $(\underline{W_1}, \underline{W_2})$ to $\underline{W_1}+\underline{W_2}$, letting context determine whether we think of $\underline{W_1}$ as an element of $C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_U)$ or $C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U \cup V})$ and similarly for $\underline{W_2}$.
	This induces a well-defined map $\psi \colon S^* \to C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U \cup V})$ as it takes elements in the image of $(i_U,-i_V)$ to $0$.
	To establish the quasi-isomorphism, we use creasing.

	First suppose a cocycle $\uW \in C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U \cup V})$ represented by $r_W \colon W \to U \cup V$.
	Let $\phi \colon U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$ separate $W$ over $U$ and $V$.
	By \cref{T: cohomology creasing}, we have $\uW = \underline{W^-}+\underline{W^+} \in H^*_\Gamma(M)$.
	But by the creasing construction, if $W$ has image in $U \cup V$ then so does $\Cre(W)$, so the equality $\uW = \underline{W^-}+\underline{W^+}$ also holds in $H_*^\Gamma(M|_{U \cup V})$.
	Similarly, $\underline{W^-} \in C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U})$ and $\underline{W^+} \in C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{V})$.
	We also have $\bd W \in Q^*(M|_{U \cup V}) \subset Q^*(M)$ by assumption that $W$ is a cocycle.
	By the computation in \cref{E: codim 1 pullbacks}, we have $\bd(W^-) = -(W^0) \sqcup (\bd W)^-$, and $\bd (W^+) = W^0 \sqcup (\bd W)^+$.
	As $\bd W \in Q^*(M)$ with image in $U \cup V$, we have $(\bd W)^\pm \in Q^*(M)$ with respective images in $U$ and $V$ by \cref{C: creasing Q}, so $(\bd W)^-$ represents in $0$ in $C^*_\Gamma(M|_U)$ and similarly $(\bd W)^+$ represents $0$ in $C^*_\Gamma(M|_V)$.
	Thus $(\underline{W^-}, \underline{W^+})$ is an element of $C_{\Gamma}^*(M|_U) \oplus C_{\Gamma}^{*}(M|_V)$ whose boundary is $(-\underline{W^0},\underline{W^0})$, which is in the image of $(i_U,-i_V)$.
	Therefore, $(\underline{W^-}, \underline{W^+})$ represents an element of
	$H^*(S^*)$ that maps to $\uW \in H^*_\Gamma(M_{U \cup V})$.
	Thus $\psi$ is surjective.

	Next, suppose $\uW$ is a cocycle in $S^*$ that maps to zero in $H_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U \cup V})$, and that $\uW$ is represented by $(\underline{W_1},\underline{W_2}) \in C^*_\Gamma(M|_U) \oplus C^*_\Gamma(M|_V)$.
	As $\uW$ maps to zero in $H_{\Gamma}^*(M|_{U \cup V})$, there is some $Z \in PC^*_\Gamma(M|_{U \cup V})$ such that $\bd Z \sqcup - W_1 \sqcup -W_2 = T \in Q^*(M|_{U \cup V})$.
	Using that $\underline T = 0$ in $C^*_\Gamma(M|_{U \cup V})$, it will be useful to write this as $\bd \underline{Z} = \underline{\bd Z} = \underline{W_1} + \underline {W_2}$ in $C^*_\Gamma(M|_{U \cup V})$.
	By \cref{L: existence of separating} there is a function $\phi \colon U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$ that is separating for $Z$, $W_1$, and $W_2$ over $U$ and $V$.
 	We claim that $(\underline{Z^-}+\underline{\Cre(W_1)},\underline{Z^+}+\underline{\Cre(W_2)}) \in C^*_\Gamma(M|_U) \oplus C^*_\Gamma(M|_V)$ represents an element of $S^*$ whose boundary is $\uW$.
	We observe again that $Z^-$ and $Z^+$ represent respective elements of $PC^*_\Gamma(M|_U)$ and $PC^*_\Gamma(M|_V)$, as they are closed subsets of $Z$, so their inclusions to $Z$ composed with $Z \to M$ are proper, and we utilize the tautological co-orientations of $Z^\pm \into Z$ as in \cref{E: codim 0 and 1 co-or as fiber products}.

	As $\bd Z \sqcup - W_1 \sqcup -W_2 \in Q^*(M|_{U \cup V})$, \cref{C: creasing Q} implies that $(\bd Z)^- \sqcup (- W_1)^- \sqcup (-W_2)^- \in Q^*(M|_U)$ and $(\bd Z)^+ \sqcup (- W_1)^+ \sqcup (-W_2)^+ \in Q^*(M|_V)$, so $\underline{(\bd Z)^- }= \underline{W_1^-} + \underline{W_2^-}$ and $\underline{(\bd Z)^+} = \underline{W_1^+} + \underline{W_2^+}$ in $C^*_\Gamma(M|_U)$ and $C^*_\Gamma(M|_V)$, respectively.
	So we can compute using \cref{E: codim 1 pullbacks,E: bd crease}:
	\begin{align*}
		\bd (\underline{Z^-}&+\underline{\Cre(W_1)},\underline{Z^+}+\underline{\Cre(W_2)})\\
		&= (\bd (\underline{Z^-})+\bd \underline{\Cre(W_1)},\bd (\underline{Z^+})+\bd\underline{\Cre(W_2)})\\
		& = (-\underline{Z^0} + \underline{(\bd Z)^-}+\underline{W_1} -\underline{W_1^-} - \underline{W_1^+} -\underline{\Cre(\bd W_1)},\underline{Z^0} + \underline{(\bd Z)^+} +\underline{W_2} -\underline{W_2^-} -\underline{W_2^+} -\underline{\Cre(\bd W_2)})\\
		& = (-\underline{Z^0} + \underline{W_1^-} + \underline{W_2^-} +\underline{W_1} -\underline{W_1^-} -\underline{W_1^+} -\underline{\Cre(\bd W_1)},\underline{Z^0}+ \underline{W_1^+}+ \underline{W_2^+} +\underline{W_2} -\underline{W_2^-} -\underline{W_2^+} -\underline{\Cre(\bd W_2)})\\
		& = (-\underline{Z^0} + \underline{W_2^-} + \underline{W_1} -\underline{W_1^+} -\underline{\Cre(\bd W_1)},\underline{Z^0}+ \underline{W_1^+} + \underline{W_2} -\underline{W_2^-} -\underline{\Cre(\bd W_2))})\\
		& = (\underline{W_1},\underline{W_2})+ (-\underline{Z^0},\underline{Z^0}) + (\underline{W_2^-}-\underline{W_1^+}, \underline{W_1^+} -\underline{W_2^-}) -(\underline{\Cre(\bd W_1)},\underline{\Cre(\bd W_2)}).
	\end{align*}
	To see that this is equal to $\uW = (\underline{W_1},\underline{W_2})$ in $S^*$, we first note the middle two terms are each in the image of $(i_U, -i_V)$, so they represent $0$ in $S^*$.
	It remains to show that $(\underline{\Cre(\bd W_1)},\underline{\Cre(\bd W_2)})=0$ in $S^*$.

 This term is obtained by applying the creasing construction to the entries of $(\bd W_1,\bd W_2)$, which by assumption represents $0$ in $S^*$.
	In general, suppose $A \in PC^*_{\Gamma}(M|_U)$ and $B \in PC^*_\Gamma(M|_V)$ such that $(\underline{A}, \underline{B}) \in C^*_\Gamma(M|_U) \oplus C^*_\Gamma(M|_V)$ represents zero in $S^*$.
	This means that $(A,B)$ is equivalent in $C^*_\Gamma(M|_U) \oplus C^*_\Gamma(M|_V)$ to an element of the form $(i_U,-i_V)(\underline{C})$ for some $C \in PC^*_{\Gamma}(M|_{U \cap V})$, i.e.\ that $A \sqcup -i_U(C) \in Q^*(M|_U)$ and $B \sqcup i_V(C) \in Q^*(V)$.
	Creasing preserves both support and membership in $Q^*$ by definition and by \cref{C: creasing Q}, so we have
	$$\Cre(A \sqcup -i_U(C)) = \Cre(A) \sqcup -\Cre(i_U(C)) = \Cre(A) \sqcup -i_U(\Cre(C)),$$
	and this is an element of $Q^*(M|_U)$.
	The equivalent computations holds for the other term in $V$.
	So in $C^*_\Gamma(M|_U)\oplus C^*_\Gamma(M|_U)$, we have
 $$0= (\underline{\Cre(A)} -\underline{i_U(\Cre(C))}, \underline{\Cre(B)} + \underline{i_V(\Cre(C))}) = (\underline{\Cre(A)},\underline{\Cre(B)}) +(i_U(\underline{\Cre(C)}), -i_V(\underline{\Cre(C)})).$$
	Consequently, $(\underline{\Cre(A)},\underline{\Cre(B)})$ is in the image of $(i_U, -i_V)$ and so represents $0$ in $S^*$.

	Applying this argument to $(\underline{\Cre(\bd W_1)},\underline{\Cre(\bd W_2))})$, we conclude that
	$\bd (\underline{Z^-} + \underline{\Cre(W_1)},\underline{Z^+} + \underline{\Cre(W_2)}) = (\underline{W_1},\underline{W_2}) = \uW$ in $S^*$, and so $\psi$ is injective.

	The one difference in the homological case is that in our above computation of $$\bd (\underline{Z^-} + \underline{\Cre(W_1)},\underline{Z^+} + \underline{\Cre(W_2)})$$ the term $(-\underline{Z^0},\underline{Z^0})$ will instead be $(\underline{Z^0},-\underline{Z^0})$ due to the difference in signs in the boundary formulas in \cref{L: W0 cochain,L: W0 chain}.
	However, this does not alter the overall argument.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{R: MV boundary}
	By the computations above and the standard zig-zag construction of long exact sequences from short exact sequences, the connecting homomorphism in our Mayer--Vietoris sequence takes the cohomology class represented by the cocycle $\uW \in C^*_\Gamma(M|_{U \cup V})$ to the class represented by $-\underline{W^0} \in C^*_\Gamma(M|_{U \cap V})$, where $W^0$ is determined by a function that separates $W$ over $U$ and $V$.

	The description for the homology sequence is similar, except that, using \cref{L: W0 chain}, the connecting homomorphism takes the homology class represented by the cycle $\uW \in C_*^\Gamma(U \cup V)$ to the class represented by $\underline{W^0} \in C_*^\Gamma(U \cap V)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{comment}
	Since $U$ is diffeomorphic
	to an open ball, there is a homotopy $F$ between the identity map on $U$ and a constant map.
	Consider the composite
	of $r_W \times id \colon W \times I \to U \times I$ with $F$ obtain a manifold over $M$, which we call $P_W$.
	If $W$ is trivial then so is $P_W$ as the
	the product of the involution on $W$ with the identity map defines a suitable involution on $W \times I$.
	If $W$ is degenerate then so is $P_W$,
	as it is small rank and its boundary is the union of $W \times \bd I$, which is small rank, and $\bd W \times I$, which is trivial or small rank
	as $\bd W$ is.

	The construction $W \to P_W$ provides a well-defined chain homotopy between
	the identity and the trivial map.
	Thus we have that $H^*_\Gamma(M|_U) \cong H^*_\Gamma(M|_{pt}) \cong H^{*-m}_\Gamma(pt)$.
	Finally, we observe that $H^*_\Gamma(pt) = H_*^\Gamma(pt)$ by definition (observing that a co-orientation of a map $W \to pt$ is equivalent to an orientation of $W$ \red{[GBF: do we need to explain this further? choose a convention?]}), while $H^\Gamma_*(pt)$ agrees with the singular homology of the point by \cite[Theorem 3]{Lipy14}.

\begin{example}[Homology of spheres]\label{E: sphere homology}
Given the dimension axiom (\cref{E: dimension}), homotopy invariance, and Mayer-Vietoris sequences, the geometric homology groups of spheres can now be computed formally to agree with the singular homology of spheres, i.e.\ for $n>0$ we have $H_0^{\Gamma}(S^n)\cong H_n^\Gamma(S^n)\cong \Z$ and all other homology groups are $0$.
By \cref{E: first examples}, a generator of $H_0^{\Gamma}(S^n)$ is represented by the inclusion of any point.
By the same example, a generator of $H_n^{\Gamma}(S^n)$ is represented by the oriented identity map $\id \colon S^n \to S^n$, although the argument there for general closed, oriented manifolds relies on results we have not yet reached.
For spheres, however, we can see this by induction.

By applying creasing at the equator $S^{n-1}\subset S^n$, we can write the homology class of $\id: S^n \to S^n$ as the union of the inclusions of the closed northern and southern hemispheres. Then writing $S^n$, $n>1$, as the union of the two overlapping disks $U$ and $V$ that extend the hemispheres in the usual way, we see by a diagram chase that the Mayer-Vietoris boundary map $H_n^\Gamma(S^n)\xr{\cong} H_{n-1}^\Gamma(U \cap V)$ is an isomorphism with the image of the class of $\id: S^n \to S^n$ represented, up to sign, by the inclusion of the equator.
But $U \cap V$ has a deformation retraction to the equator $S^{n-1}$.
So if we assume inductively that $\id \colon S^{n-1} \to S^{n-1}$ represents a generator of $H_{n-1}^\Gamma(S^{n-1})\cong \Z$, the same will be true for $H_n^\Gamma(S^n)$.
The base case for $n=1$ is a bit more involved as in this case $H_1^\Gamma(S^1) \to H_{0}^\Gamma(U \cap V) \cong H_0^\Gamma(S^0) \cong \Z^2$ is only injective, not an isomorphism, but the necessary exact sequence computations in degree $0$ to show that the boundary map of the sequence takes the class represented by $\id \colon S^1 \to S^1$ onto a generator of a $\Z$ summand is nonetheless a standard exercise that we leave for the reader.
\end{example}

\end{comment}

In this section, we show that geometric cohomology possesses a contravariant Mayer--Vietoris sequence on manifolds.
This does not seem possible by deriving a long exact sequence from a short exact sequence.
For example, in general the restriction map $C^*_\Gamma(M) \to C^*_\Gamma(U)$ will not be surjective.
Consequently, this sequence will take more work than the covariant ones.

Instead, we proceed with a direct analysis at each term of the exact sequence as in Kreck's proof of the Mayer--Vietoris sequence for his cohomology theory using stratifolds in \cite{Krec10}.
In fact, our argument for exactness parallels Kreck's fairly closely.
However, our proof that the connecting map is well defined is more complicated than the analogous proof in Kreck (ignoring the extra complications in \cite{Krec10} arising from considerations of collars that we do not need).
This is because Kreck is able to define his version of separating functions directly on his representing objects as $\varphi \colon W \to [0,1]$, which then makes it possible to compare two different $\varphi$s using a cylinder $W \times I$ with different versions of $\varphi$ on each end.
Here, however, we must always use splitting maps that factor through $M$ or risk that even if $W$ is trivial $W^{\pm}$ may not be.

Throughout, there will be no loss of generality in taking $U \cup V = M$, and it will simplify notation, though we often continue to write $U \cup V$ for emphasis.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{The connecting morphism.} We first define the connecting morphism and demonstrate its naturality.
This will require quite a bit of technical work.

\begin{definition}\label{D: connecting}
	Suppose that $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of a manifold without boundary $M = U \cup V$ and that $\uW \in H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ is represented by $r_W \colon W \to U \cap V$.
	Of course we can also consider $r_W$ to have image in $U \cup V$.
	Let $\phi \colon U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$ separate $W$ over $U$ and $V$.
	Define $\delta(\uW) \in H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U \cup V) = H^{k+1}_\Gamma(M)$ to be represented by $-W^0 = -(\phi r_W)^{-1}(0)$, which we recall can be identified with $-\phi^{-1}(0)\times_M W$ by \cref{L: pm0 as fiber products}.
\end{definition}

The choice to use $-W^0$ rather than $W^0$ in the definition is explained by \cref{R: MV boundary}.
An alternative convention that uses $W^0$ rather than $-W^0$ would be to use $(-i_U,i_V)$ rather than $(i_U,-i_V)$ in our covariant Mayer--Vietoris sequences and the map $\uW \to (-\uW|_U, \uW|_V)$ rather than $\uW \to (\uW|_U, -\uW|_V)$ in our contravariant Mayer--Vietoris sequence below.

Our next goal is to show that $\delta$ is well defined, i.e.\ that $W^0$ is a precocycle in $M = U \cup V$ and that its cohomology class does not depend on the choice of representing precochain $W$ or the choice of $\phi$.
We begin with a series of lemmas.
Although we use $0$ as our regular value in our construction of $\delta$, it will be useful in our arguments to allow our regular value to be anywhere in $(-1/2,1/2)$, and we immediately work in this generality.
So for $p \in (-1/2,1/2)$, we let $M^p = \phi^{-1}(p)$ and $W^p = (\phi r_W)^{-1}(p) \cong M^p \times_{M} W$.
Note that as $\phi$ separates $U$ and $V$, we have $M^p \subset U \cap V \subset U \cup V = M$ for all $p \in (-1/2,1/2)$, so the space $M^p$ is unambiguous whether we consider the domain of $\phi$ to be $U \cup V$ or $U \cap V$.

We first show our construction does give an element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$.

\begin{lemma}
	Suppose that $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of a manifold without boundary $M = U \cup V$ and that $\uW \in H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ is represented by $r_W \colon W \to U \cap V$.
	Consider $r_W$ to have image in $U \cup V = M$.
	Let $\phi \colon U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$ separate $U$ and $V$, and let $p \in (-1/2, 1/2)$ be a regular value for $\phi$ and $\phi r_W$.
	Then $W^p = M^p \times_{M} W$ is an element of $PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ with boundary in $Q^*(M)$, so it represents an element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	For simplicity and consistency with the notation in \cref{S: codim 0 and 1 co-or,S: splitting}, we take $p = 0$, but the same argument works for any $p \in (-1/2, 1/2)$ satisfying the hypotheses.
	By \cref{L: W0 cochain}, $M^0 \times_{U\cap V} W$ is an element of $PC^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$, but we must show that the map including this fiber product into $M$ is proper.

	We know that $W \to U \cap V$ is proper by hypothesis and that the inclusion $M^0 \into M$ has image in $U \cap V$, so by \cref{L: co-orientable pullback} the pullback $W \times_{U \cap V} M^0 \to M^0$ is proper.
	And as $M^0$ is a closed subset of $M$, the inclusion $M^0 \into M$ is proper.
	So the composition map $W \times_{U \cap V} M^0 \to M^0 \into M$ is proper.
	But now clearly $W \times_{U \cap V} M^0 \cong W \times_M M^0$ as extending the codomain does not alter the fiber product, and $W \times_M M^0$ and $M^0 \times_M W$ are diffeomorphic over $M$.
	We now co-orient $M^0 \times_M W$ as a fiber product as in \cref{L: W0 cochain}, giving $W^0 = M^0 \times_M W \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$.

	Finally, as $M^0$ has no boundary, we compute using \cref{leibniz} that
	$$\bd (W^0) = - M^0 \times_{M} \bd W.$$
	But $W$ represents a cocycle in $U \cap V$, so $\bd W$ is a union of trivial and degenerate precochains in $U \cap V$.
	The definitions of trivial and degenerate do not rely on the properness of the map, so $\bd W$ will also be a union of trivial and degenerate manifolds over $M$.
	Consequently, the same is true of $M^0 \times_{M} \bd W$ by \cref{L: pullback with Q}, noting the proof of that result does not rely on any map being proper.
\end{proof}

The next lemma shows that our construction of $\delta$ does not depend on the use of $0$ as our regular value.
The proof uses $\phi^{-1}([p,q])$, so the reader should compare with \cref{L: Wpq cochain}.

\begin{lemma}\label{L: different point}
	Suppose that $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of a manifold without boundary $M = U \cup V$.
	Suppose $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ represents an element of $H^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ and that $\phi \colon M = U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$ separates $U$ and $V$.
	Let $p, q\in (-1/2,1/2)$ be any regular values for $\phi$ and $\phi r_W$.
	Then $W^p$ and $W^q$, as defined just above, represent the same element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose without loss of generality that $p<q$.
	Then the submanifold $\phi^{-1}([p,q]) \subset U \cap V \subset M$ will be transverse to $r_W \colon W \to M$.
	As $\phi^{-1}([p,q])$ is closed in $M$, its inclusion is proper, and the inclusion can be tautologically co-oriented as a codimension $0$ embedding (see \cref{D: tautological co-orientation}).
	Thus, as in \cref{L: Wpq cochain}, $$\bd(\varphi^{-1}([p,q])\times_{M} W ) = (M^p \times_{M} W)\sqcup -(M^q \times_{M} W) \sqcup (\phi^{-1}([p,q])\times_{M} \bd W).$$
	As $W$ is a cocycle, the last term is in $Q^*(M)$ (with support in $U \cap V$) by \cref{L: pullback with Q}, so $M^p \times_{M} W$ and $M^q \times_{M} W$ represent cohomologous cocycles.
\end{proof}

Next, we show independence of the representative $W$, assuming a fixed $\phi$.

\begin{lemma}\label{L: different W}
	Suppose that $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of a manifold without boundary $M = U \cup V$.
	Suppose $W_1, W_2 \in PC^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ represent the same element of $H^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$.
	Let $\phi \colon U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$ separate $U$ and $V$ and suppose $q \in (-1/2,1/2)$ is a regular value for $\phi$, $\phi r_{W_1}$, and $\phi r_{W_2}$.
	Then $W_1^q$ and $W_2^q$ represent the same element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	By assumption, there is a $Z \in PC^*_{\Gamma}(U \cap V)$ with $\bd Z \sqcup -W_1 \sqcup W_2 \in Q^*(U \cap V)$.
	For our fixed $\phi$, there is by Sard's Theorem a $p \in (-1/2,1/2)$ such that $p \into (-1/2,1/2)$ is transverse to $\phi$, $\phi r_Z$, $\phi r_{W_1}$, and $\phi r_{W_2}$.
	By the preceding lemma, it suffices to show that $W_1^p$ and $W_2^p$ represent the same element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$.

	As in the proofs of the preceding lemmas, the fiber product with $M^p$ over $M$ takes an element of $PC^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ to $PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ and an element of $Q^*(U \cap V)$ to $Q^*(M)$.
	So
	$$M^p \times_{M}(\bd Z \sqcup -W_1 \sqcup W_2) = (\bd Z)^p \sqcup -W_1^p \sqcup W_2^p$$
	is an element of $Q^*(M)$.
	Furthermore, by an obvious modification to \cref{C: co-orient W0}, we have $\bd (Z^p) = -(\bd Z)^p$.
	So $$-\bd (Z^p) \sqcup -W_1^p \sqcup W_2^p \in Q^*(M),$$
	which implies that $W_1^p$ and $W_2^p$ represent the same cohomology class in $M$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{P: connecting}
	Suppose that $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of a manifold without boundary $M = U \cup V$.
	The map $H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V) \xr{\delta} H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U \cup V) = H^{k+1}_\Gamma(M)$ is well defined.
	In particular, it does not depend on the choice of separating function.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose $W_1$ and $W_2$ represent the same element of $H^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ and that we choose functions $\phi_1,\phi_2$ that are respectively separating for $W_1$ and $W_2$ over $U$ and $V$.
	We must show that $\phi_1^{-1}(0)\times_{M} W_1$ and $\phi_2^{-1}(0)\times_{M} W_2$ represent the same element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$.

	By Sard's Theorem, we can find points $p_1<p_2$ in $(-1/2,1/2)$ such that $p_1$ is a regular value for $\phi$ and $\phi_1 r_{W_1}$ and $p_2$ is a regular value for all of $\phi$, $\phi_1 r_{W_1}$, $\phi_2 r_{W_1}$, and $\phi_2 r_{W_2}$.
	By \cref{L: different point}, $\phi_1^{-1}(0) \times_{M} W_1$ and $\phi_2^{-1}(0) \times_{M} W_2$ represent the same elements of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$ respectively as $\phi_1^{-1}(p_1) \times_{M} W_1$ and $\phi_2^{-1}(p_2) \times_{M} W_2$.
	Further, by \cref{L: different W}, $\phi_2^{-1}(p_2) \times_{M} W_2$ represents the same cohomology class as $\phi_2^{-1}(p_2) \times_{M} W_1$.
	So it suffices to show that $\phi_1^{-1}(p_1) \times_{M} W_1$ represents the same cohomology class as $\phi_2^{-1}(p_2) \times_{M} W_1$.

 	So for simplicity of notation, let us suppose a single precochain $W$ and two separating functions $\phi_1,\phi_2$ such that $p_1 < p_2$ are respective regular values for $\phi$, $\phi_1 r_W$, and $\phi_2 r_W$.

	First, suppose there exists $q$ with $-1/2<q<p_2$ such that $\phi_1^{-1}(p_1) \subset \phi_2^{-1}([-1/2,q])$.
	By postcomposing $\phi_1$ with a diffeomorphism of $[-1/2,1/2]$, we may suppose that $p_1<q$.
	Let us choose $u_1,u_2$ such that $-1/2<u_1<p_1<u_1<q$.
	Using the Urysohn lemma we can find a continuous $\hat \Phi$ on $M$ such that:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\hat \Phi$ is equal to $\phi_1$ on $\phi_1^{-1}[u_1,u_2]$,
		\item $\hat\Phi$ is equal to $\phi_2$ on $\phi_2^{-1}([q,1/2])$,

		\item $\hat\Phi$ takes $U - V$ to $-1/2$,

		\item $\hat\Phi^{-1}(p_1) = \phi_1^{-1}(p_1)$,

		\item $\hat\Phi^{-1}(p_2) = \phi_2^{-1}(p_2)$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Furthermore, by a sufficiently small homotopy $\hat\Phi$ can be approximated by a smooth function $\Phi$ that is still separating, preserves the last two properties, and, for some $\epsilon >0$, agrees with $\phi_1$ on $\phi_1^{-1}((p_1-\epsilon,p_2+\epsilon))$ and with $\phi_2$ on $\phi_2^{-1}((p_2-\epsilon,p_2+\epsilon))$.
	Then $p_1$ and $p_2$ are regular values for $\Phi$ and $\Phi r_W$, and
	we have $\Phi^{-1}(p_1) \times_{M} W \cong \phi_1^{-1}(p_1) \times_{M} W$ and similar for $p_2$ and $\phi_2$.
	So now $\Phi^{-1}(p_1) \times_{M} W$ and $\Phi^{-1}(p_2) \times_{M} W$ represent the same element in $H^*_\Gamma(M)$ by \cref{L: different point}.

	While this argument is written for $\phi_1^{-1}(p_1)$ ``below some $q<p_2$,'' clearly an analogous argument holds for $\phi_1^{-1}(p_1)$ ``above some $q>p_2$,'' or with the roles of $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ reversed.

	Lastly, we have to consider the case where there is not a $q$ as in the preceding paragraph that allows us to separate $\phi_1^{-1}(p_1)$ from $\phi_2^{-1}(p_2)$.
	In this case we will modify $\phi_2$ in an appropriate way.
	Let use choose $r$ with $p_2 <r<1/2$.
	Define $\hat \Phi$ as follows:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item On $\phi_2^{-1}([-1/2,r])$, take $\hat \Phi = \phi_2$,

		\item On $\phi_2^{-1}([r,1/2])$ use the Urysohn Lemma to construct a continuous function $\phi_2^{-1}([r,1/2]) \to [r,1/2]$ that takes $\phi_2^{-1}(r) \cup [\phi_2^{-1}([r,1/2]) \cap \phi_1^{-1}(p_1)]$ to $r$ and $V - U$ to $1/2$; let $\hat \Phi$ be this constructed function on $\phi_2^{-1}([r,1/2]$.
	\end{enumerate}

	Now, we can modify $\hat \Phi$ by an $\epsilon$-homotopy fixing $\phi_2^{-1}([-1/2,r])$ and $\Phi^{-1}(1/2)$ to a smooth $\Phi$ with $\Phi^{-1}(p_2) = \phi_2^{-1}(p_2)$ and such that there is a $q$, $r<q<1$, with $\phi_1^{-1}(p_1) \subset \Phi^{-1}([-1/2,q])$.
	We can now choose a $p_2'$ with $q<p_2'<1$ that separates $W$ via $\Phi$.
	From our previous cases, we know $\Phi^{-1}(p_2')\times_{M}W$ is cohomologous to $\Phi^{-1}(p_2)\times_{M}W = \phi_2^{-1}(p_2)\times_{M}W$, but $\Phi^{-1}(p_2')$ and $\phi_1^{-1}(p_1)$ are now related as in the preceding case.

	Altogether we have shown that $\delta$ is independent of choices.
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
\begin{lemma}\label{L: natural connection}
	The connecting map $\delta$ is natural, i.e.\ for a continuous map $f \colon U' \cup V' \to U \cup V$ such that $f(U') \subset U$ and $f(V' \subset V)$ with both $U \cap V$ and $U' \cap V'$ non-empty, the following diagram commutes for all $k$:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V) \arrow[r, "\delta"] \arrow[d, "f^*"] & H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U \cup V) \arrow[d, "f^*"] \\
		H^k_\Gamma(U' \cap V') \arrow[r, "\delta"] & H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U' \cup V').
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Consider $\uW \in H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ represented by $r_W \colon W \to U \cap V$.
	We can find a $\phi \colon U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$ that is separating for $U$ and $V$ and such that $\phi f$ is separating for $U'$ and $V'$

HEREHEREHEREPROBLEM

	This can be remedied by a small homotopy of $f$ to $g$.
	This homotopy may not preserve the property that $f(U') \subset U$ and $f(V') \subset V$ but we may choose the homotopy small enough that $(\phi g)^{-1}([-1/4,1/4]) \subset (\phi f)^{-1}(-1/3,1/3)$, which will be sufficient to ensure that $(\phi g)^{-1}([-1/4,1/4]) \subset U' \cap V'$.
	We may further assume via \cref{T: basic trans} that the homotopy has been chosen so that $g$ is transverse to $r_W \colon W \to N$ and $r_{W^0} \colon W^0 \to N$.
	By \cref{D: cohomology pullback and homology transfer}, the pullback of $W \to N$ by $g$ represents $f^*(\uW)$. \greg{Need to add to \cref{T: basic trans} that homotopy can be taken small}

	We first need to show that $(W \times_N M)^0$ is well defined.
	It suffices to show that the transversality of $g$ with $r_{W^0}$ implies that $0$ is a regular value for the composition $\phi g r_W^*$, where we let $r_W^*$ be the pullback of $W$ to $M$ via $g$, i.e.\ $r_W^*: W \times_N M \to M$.
	So we must show that the restriction of $\phi gr_W^*$ to each stratum of $W \times_N M$ is transverse to $0$.
	Recall by \cref{pullback} that $S^k(W \times_N M) = S^k(W) \times_N M$, as $M$ is without boundary.
	Similarly, we note for a bit later that $$S^k(W^0) = S^k(N^0 \times_N W) = N^0 \times_N S^k(W) = (S^k(W))^0.$$
	So let $(x,y) \in S^k(W) \times_N M$ with $x \in S^k(W)$ and $y \in M$ be a point that maps to $0$ under $\phi gr_W^*$, and let $z = r_W(x) = g(y) \in N$.
	As $D_x(r_W|_{S^k(W)}) = D_xr_W|_{T_xS^k(W)}$, we will simply write $D_xr_W$ rather than $D_x(r_W|_{S^k(W)})$ in what follows.
	Now, recall that the tangent bundle of the pullback is the pullback of the tangent bundles by \cref{L: tangent of pullbacks}, so the tangent space of $S^k(W) \times_N M$ is $T_x S^k(W) \times_{T_{z}N} T_yM$.
	As $0$ is a regular value for $\phi r_W$, and so in particular a regular value for $\phi \circ r_W|_{S^k(W)}$, there must be a vector $\xi \in T_xS^k(W)$ with $D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)\neq 0$.
	So $D_xr_W(\xi) \neq 0$.
	As $g$ is assumed transverse to $W^0 \to N$, there must be $\alpha \in T_xS^k(W^0)$ and $\beta \in T_yM$ such that $D_xr_W(\xi) = D_xr_W(\alpha) + D_yg (\beta)$.
	Rewriting, $D_yg (\beta) = D_xr_W(\xi-\alpha)$.
	As $\alpha \in T_xW^0 \in \ker(D_x (\phi r_W))$, we have $$D_{z}\phi(D_yg (\beta)) = D_{z}\phi \circ D_xr_W(\xi-\alpha) = D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)-D_x(\phi r_W)(\alpha) = D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)\neq 0.$$
	So, recalling that $Dr_W^*$ is simply the projection to $T_yM$, the pair $( \xi-\alpha, \beta)$ is a non-zero vector in $$T_{(x,y)}(S^k(W) \times_N M) = T_x S^k(W) \times_{T_{z}N} T_yM$$ that maps by $D(\phi gr_W^*)$ to $D_{z}\phi(D_yg (\beta)) \neq 0 \in T_{0}[-1,1]$.
	As $(x,y)$ was an arbitrary point of $(\phi gr^*_{W})^{-1}(0) \subset W \times_N M$, this shows that $0$ is a regular value for $\phi gr^*_W$.

	Now we have from the definitions that $f^*\delta(W)$ is represented by $(-W^0) \times_N M = -(N^0 \times_N W) \times_N M$, treating $N^0 \times_N W$ as a fiber product and $(-W^0) \times_N M$ as a pullback over $M$.
	On the other hand, $\delta f^*(W) = -(W \times_{U \cap V} (U' \cap V'))^0 = -(W \times_N M)^0 = -M^0 \times_M (W \times_N M)$, where $W \times_N M$ is the pullback to $M$ and then we take the fiber product with $M^0$.
	In both cases, these translate to the pairs of points $(x,y) \in W \times M$ with $r_W(x) = g(y)$ and $\phi(r_W(x)) = \phi(g(y)) = 0$.
	In other words, as spaces these are both precisely the limit of the following diagram together with its map to $M$:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		& M \arrow[d,"g"] & \\
		W \arrow[r, "r_W"] & N \arrow[r, "\phi"] & {[-1,1]} & \arrow[l,hook'] 0
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	Thus $f^*\delta(\uW)$ and $\delta f^*(\uW)$ are represented by the same map, and we only need to check co-orientations.

	We return to the definitions of the pullback and fiber product co-orientations.
	It suffices to compare $(W \times_N M)^0$ and $W^0 \times_N M$ at an arbitrary point.
	We first consider the co-orientation in the form $(W \times_N M)^0$.
	For the pullback $W \times_N M \to M$, choose $e \colon W \into N \times \R^K$.
	At our chosen point, fix $\beta_N$ and choose $\beta_W$ so that $\omega_{r_W} = (\beta_W,\beta_N)$.
	Let $\nu$ be the Quillen-oriented normal bundle of $W$ in $N \times \R^K$ so that $\beta_W \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$, where $\beta_E$ is the standard orientation of $\R^K$.
	Then by definition the pullback map from $P = W \times_N M \subset M \times \R^K$ to $M$ is co-oriented by $(\beta_P,\beta_M)$ if we choose $\beta_P$ and $\beta_M$ such that $\beta_P \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \times \beta_E$, recalling that we let $\beta_\nu$ also denote the pulled back normal bundle of $P$ in $M \times \R^K$.
	We suppose we have chosen such $\beta_P$ and $\beta_M$.
	Next, let $M^0 \subset M$ have normal co-orientation $\beta_\phi$ determined by pulling back the standard orientation from $(-1,1)$, and similarly let $\beta_\phi$ denote the pullback normal co-orientation to $(W \times_N M)^0$.
	Then by \cref{P: codim 1 co-orient}, the co-orientation of the pullback $(W \times_N M)^0 = M^0 \times_M (W \times_N M) \to W \times_N M$ is $(\beta_Q,\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi)$ for any $\beta_Q$.
	The fiber product $(W \times_N M)^0 \into M$ is then co-oriented by the composition $(\beta_Q,\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi)*(\beta_P,\beta_M)$.
	So if we choose $\beta_Q$ so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi = \beta_P$ (or equivalently $\beta_Q$ and $\beta_M$ so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \wedge \beta_E$), the co-orientation is $(\beta_Q,\beta_M)$.
	\greg{G. note to self: Double check that \cref{P: codim 1 co-orient} still works here given recent changes to its statement.}

	On the other hand, consider $(N^0 \times_N W) \times_N M = W^0 \times_N M \to M$.
	One again we fix $\beta_N$ and $\beta_W$ so that $\omega_{r_W} = (\beta_W,\beta_N)$.
	Again by \cref{P: codim 1 co-orient}, the co-orientation of the pullback $N^0 \times_N W \to W$ is $(\beta_{W^0},\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi)$ for any $\beta_{W^0}$, continuing to let $\beta_\phi$ denote any normal co-orientation pulled back via $\phi$.
	If we choose $\beta_{W^0}$ so that $\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi = \beta_W$ then we have $r_{W^0} \colon W^0 \to N$ co-oriented by $(\beta_{W^0},\beta_N)$.
	As $W^0 \subset W$, we can embed $W^0$ in $N \times \R^K$ via the composition $W^0 \into W \xhookrightarrow{e}N \times \R^K$, using the same $e$ and $K$ as above.
	As $\beta_W \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$ and $\beta_W = \beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi$, we have $\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$ so that $\beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu$ is the Quillen orientation for the normal bundle of $W^0$ in $N \times \R^K$.
	Using this to pull back $W^0 \to N$ to $W^0 \times_N M \to M$, by definition the pullback co-orientation is $(\beta_Q,\beta_M)$ when $\beta_Q$ and $\beta_M$ are chosen so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \wedge \beta_E$.
	But this is exactly the same co-orientation we arrived at in the preceding paragraph.
	Thus the co-orientations of the two constructions agree.

	We conclude that the diagram of the lemma commutes.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{T: natural connection}
	The connecting map $\delta$ is natural, i.e.\ for a continuous map $f \colon U' \cup V' \to U \cup V$ such that $f(U') \subset U$ and $f(V') \subset V$, the following diagram commutes for all $k$:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V) \arrow[r, "\delta"] \arrow[d, "f^*"] & H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U \cup V) \arrow[d, "f^*"] \\
		H^k_\Gamma(U' \cap V') \arrow[r, "\delta"] & H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U' \cup V').
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
\end{theorem}

We start with a lemma that will be needed in the proof of \cref{T: natural connection} and is of somewhat independent interest.

\begin{lemma}\label{L: cut pullback}
	Suppose $M$ and $N$ are manifolds without corners and that $\phi \colon N \to \R$ is smooth with $0$ a regular value.
	Suppose $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(N)$ and that $r_W \colon W \to N$ is transverse to $N^0$.
	Further, suppose $g \colon M \to N$ is smooth and transverse to both $W \to N$ and $W^0 \to N$.
	Then the pullback $W^0 \times_N M \to M$ is co-oriented isomorphic to $(W \times_N M)^0 \to M$, where this splitting of $W \times_N M$ is with respect to the composite $\phi g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We first note that $W^0 \times_N M$ is well defined as we assume $g$ is transverse to $W^0 \to N$.

	Now, let us write the pullback of $W$ by $g$, which exists by the transversality of $g$ and $r_W$, as $r_W^* \colon W \times_N M \to M$.
	To see that $(W \times_N M)^0$ is well defined, it suffices to show that the transversality of $g$ with $r_{W^0}$ implies that $0$ is a regular value for the composition $\phi g r_W^*$.
	So we must show that the restriction of $\phi gr_W^*$ to each stratum of $W \times_N M$ is transverse to $0$.
	Recall by \cref{pullback} that $S^k(W \times_N M) = S^k(W) \times_N M$, as $M$ is without boundary.
	Similarly, we note for a bit later that $$S^k(W^0) = S^k(N^0 \times_N W) = N^0 \times_N S^k(W) = (S^k(W))^0.$$
	So let $(x,y) \in S^k(W) \times_N M$ with $x \in S^k(W)$ and $y \in M$ such that $\phi g(y)=0$, and let $z = r_W(x) = g(y) \in N$.
	As $D_x(r_W|_{S^k(W)}) = (D_xr_W)|_{T_xS^k(W)}$, we will simply write $D_xr_W$ rather than $D_x(r_W|_{S^k(W)})$ in what follows.
	We recall that the tangent bundle of the pullback is the pullback of the tangent bundles by \cref{L: tangent of pullbacks}, so the tangent space of $S^k(W) \times_N M$ is $T_x S^k(W) \times_{T_{z}N} T_yM$.
	As $r_W$ is transverse to $N^0$, we know $0$ is a regular value for $\phi r_W$; see \cref{S: splitting}.
	So, in particular, zero is a regular value for $\phi \circ r_W|_{S^k(W)}$, so there must be a vector $\xi \in T_xS^k(W)$ with $D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)\neq 0$.
	Thus $D_xr_W(\xi) \neq 0$.
	As $g$ is assumed transverse to $W^0 \to N$, there must be $\alpha \in T_xS^k(W^0)$ and $\beta \in T_yM$ such that $D_xr_W(\xi) = D_xr_W(\alpha) + D_yg (\beta)$.
	Rewriting, $D_yg (\beta) = D_xr_W(\xi-\alpha)$.
	As $\alpha \in T_xW^0 \in \ker(D_x (\phi r_W))$, we have $$D_{z}\phi(D_yg (\beta)) = D_{z}\phi \circ D_xr_W(\xi-\alpha) = D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)-D_x(\phi r_W)(\alpha) = D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)\neq 0.$$
	So, recalling that $Dr_W^*$ is simply the projection to $T_yM$, the pair $( \xi-\alpha, \beta)$ is a non-zero vector in $$T_{(x,y)}(S^k(W) \times_N M) = T_x S^k(W) \times_{T_{z}N} T_yM$$ that maps by $D(\phi gr_W^*)$ to $D_{z}\phi(D_yg (\beta)) \neq 0 \in T_{0}[-1/2, 1/2]$.
	As $(x,y)$ was an arbitrary point of $(\phi gr^*_{W})^{-1}(0) \subset W \times_N M$, this shows that $0$ is a regular value for $\phi gr^*_W$.
	So $(W \times_N M)^0$ is well defined.

	Now, from the definitions and \cref{S: splitting}, $W^0 \times_N M = (N^0 \times_N W) \times_N M$, treating $N^0 \times_N W$ as a fiber product and $W^0 \times_N M$ as a pullback over $M$.
	On the other hand, $(W \times_N M)^0 = M^0 \times_M (W \times_N M)$, where $W \times_N M$ is the pullback to $M$ and then we take the fiber product with $M^0$.
	In both cases, these translate to the pairs of points $(x,y) \in W \times M$ with $r_W(x) = g(y)$ and $\phi(r_W(x)) = \phi(g(y)) = 0$.
	In other words, as spaces these are both precisely the limit of the following diagram, together with its map to $M$:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		& M \arrow[d,"g"] & \\
		W \arrow[r, "r_W"] & N \arrow[r, "\phi"] & \R & \arrow[l,hook'] 0.
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	Thus $(W \times_N M)^0$ and $W^0 \times_N M$ are diffeomorphic over $M$, and it remains to check the co-orientations.

	We return to the definitions of the pullback and fiber product co-orientations.
	It suffices to compare $(W \times_N M)^0$ and $W^0 \times_N M$ at an arbitrary point of the top stratum.
	We first consider the co-orientation of $(W \times_N M)^0$.
	Let $(x,y) \in (W \times_N M)^0$ with $r_W(x) = g(y) = z$.
	Choose $e \colon W \into N \times \R^K$, fix $\beta_N$ at $z$, and choose $\beta_W$ at $x$ so that $\omega_{r_W} = (\beta_W,\beta_N)$.
	Let $\nu$ be the Quillen-oriented normal bundle of $W$ in $N \times \R^K$ so that $\beta_W \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$, where $\beta_E$ is the standard orientation of $\R^K$.
	Then, by definition, the pullback map from $P = W \times_N M \subset M \times \R^K$ to $M$ is co-oriented by $(\beta_P,\beta_M)$ if we choose $\beta_P$ and $\beta_M$ such that $\beta_P \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \times \beta_E$, recalling that we let $\nu$ also denote the pulled back normal bundle of $P$ in $M \times \R^K$.
	We suppose we have chosen such $\beta_P$ and $\beta_M$.
	Next, let $M^0 \subset M$ have normal co-orientation $\beta_\phi$ determined by pulling back the standard orientation from $\R$, and similarly let $\beta_\phi$ denote the pullback normal co-orientation to $(W \times_N M)^0$.
	Then by \cref{P: codim 1 co-orient}, the co-orientation of the inclusion $(W \times_N M)^0 = M^0 \times_M (W \times_N M) \hookrightarrow W \times_N M$ is $(\beta_Q,\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi)$ for any $\beta_Q$.
	The fiber product $(W \times_N M)^0 \into M$ is then co-oriented by the composition $(\beta_Q,\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi)*(\beta_P,\beta_M)$.
	So if we choose $\beta_Q$ so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi = \beta_P$ (or equivalently $\beta_Q$ and $\beta_M$ so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \wedge \beta_E$), the co-orientation is $(\beta_Q,\beta_M)$.

	On the other hand, consider $(N^0 \times_N W) \times_N M = W^0 \times_N M \to M$.
	Once again, at the same points, we fix $\beta_N$ and $\beta_W$ so that $\omega_{r_W} = (\beta_W,\beta_N)$.
	Again by \cref{P: codim 1 co-orient}, the co-orientation of the pullback $N^0 \times_N W \to W$ is $(\beta_{W^0},\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi)$ for any $\beta_{W^0}$, continuing to let $\beta_\phi$ denote any normal co-orientation pulled back via $\phi$.
	If we choose $\beta_{W^0}$ so that $\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi = \beta_W$ then we have $r_{W^0} \colon W^0 \to N$ co-oriented by $(\beta_{W^0},\beta_N)$.
	As $W^0 \subset W$, we can embed $W^0$ in $N \times \R^K$ via the composition $W^0 \into W \xhookrightarrow{e}N \times \R^K$, using the same $e$ and $K$ as above.
	We also assume the same oriented normal bundle $\nu$.
	As $\beta_W \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$ and $\beta_W = \beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi$, we have $\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$ so that $\beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu$ is the Quillen orientation for the normal bundle of $W^0$ in $N \times \R^K$.
	Using this to pull back $W^0 \to N$ to $W^0 \times_N M \to M$, by definition the pullback co-orientation is $(\beta_Q,\beta_M)$ when $\beta_Q$ and $\beta_M$ are chosen so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \wedge \beta_E$.
	But this is exactly the same co-orientation we arrived at in the preceding paragraph.
	Thus the co-orientations of the two constructions agree.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{T: natural connection}]
	We first establish some notation.
	Let $M = U' \cup V'$ and $N = U \cup V$.
	Let $A = U' \cap V'$ and $B = U \cap V$.
	Let $r_W \colon W \to B \subset N$ represent an element $\uW \in H^*_\Gamma(B)$.
	Let $\psi \colon M \to [-1/2, 1/2]$ be separating for $U'$ and $V'$, and let $\phi \colon N \to [-1/2, 1/2]$ be separating for $U$ and $V$.
	We further suppose $0$ is a regular value for $\psi$ and that $\phi$ separates $W$ over $U$ and $V$, treating $W$ as having image in $N$.
	Let $N^0$ and $W^0$ be determined by $\phi$ as in \cref{S: splitting}, and similarly, let $M^0$ be determined by $\psi$.
	We let $r_{W^0} \colon W^0 \to N$ be the reference map for $W^0$.
	By postcomposing $\psi$ with an orientation preserving-diffeomorphism of $[-1/2, 1/2]$, we may assume that $\pm 1/4$ are regular values for $\psi$, and we let $K = \psi^{-1}([-1/4, 1/4]) \subset M$.

	Now, noting that $f(A) \subset B$, apply\footnote{To obtain transversality to both $W$ and $W^0$, it suffices to choose $g_1$ transverse to the disjoint union of $r_{W^+} \colon W^+ \to M$ and $r_{W^-} \colon W^- \to M$. For both $g_1$ and $g_1|_{M^0}$ to have the desired transversality, we note that the restriction of the function $H$ constructed in the proof of \cref{T: basic trans} to $M^0 \times D$ has the desired transversality at almost every $s \in D$ by the same argument as for $H$ on all of $M \times D$. As the intersection of two almost everywhere sets also has measure zero complement, we can choose an $s \in D$ that gives transversality for both $M$ and $M^0$. Compare the proof of the Transversality Homotopy Theorem in \cite{GuPo74}, which allows that our analogue of $M$ have boundary.} \cref{T: basic trans} to obtain $g_1 \colon A \to B$, a smooth approximation to $f|_A$ that is transverse to $r_W$ and $r_{W^0}$ and so that the restriction to $M^0$ is also transverse to $W$.
	Then $f^*(\uW) \in H^*_\Gamma(A)$ is represented by the pullback of $W$ by $g_1$ by \cref{D: cohomology pullback and homology transfer}.
	For clarity, we write this pullback as $g_1^*(W) = W \times_B A$.
	By \cref{L: transverse to pullback}, as $g_1|_{M^0}$ is transverse to $W$, the inclusion of $M^0$ into $M$ is transverse to $g_1^*(W)$.
	The fiber product $ - M^0 \times_M g_1^*(W)$ represents $\delta f^* (W)$ by \cref{D: connecting}.

\begin{comment}
	Next, let $K' = \psi^{-1}([-3/8, 3/8]) \subset A \subset M$.
	We may assume that $\psi$ was chosen so that $\pm 3/8$ are also regular values.
\end{comment}

	Next, to consider $f^* \delta (\uW)$, we wish to construct a homotopy from $f$ to a map $g_2 \colon M \to N$ such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $g_2 = g_1$ on $K$,
		\item $g_2$ is smooth,
		\item $g_2$ is transverse to $W$ and $W^0$
		\item $g_2$ takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,1/4])$ to $U$ and $\psi^{-1}([-1/4,1/2])$ to $V$.
	\end{enumerate}
	We will show that we can construct such a $g_2$ in a lemma following the remainder of the proof of \cref{T: natural connection}.

	Assuming $g_2$ exists, by definition $f^* \delta (\uW)$ is represented by the pullback of $-W^0 \to N$ by $g_2$, which we will write $g_2^*(-W^0) = - g_2^*(W^0) \to M$.
	Now we apply \cref{L: cut pullback} to see that $g_2^*(W^0)$ is isomorphic to $(g_2^*(W))^0$, where the latter expression is the splitting with respect to the composite $\phi g_2$.
	In other words, $g_2^*(W^0) = M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M g_2^*(W)$, writing $M^0_{\phi g_2}$ for the splitting of $M$ determined by the function $\phi g_2$.

	So to complete the proof we must show that this $M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M g_2^*(W)$ represents the same cohomology class in $M$ as $M^0_\psi \times_M g_1^*(W)$, where $M^0_\psi$ is the splitting of $M$ using $\psi$.

	We next observe that as $M^0_\psi$ is in the interior of $K$, where we know $g_1 = g_2$, we must have $M^0_\psi \times_M g_1^*(W) = M^0_\psi \times_M g_2^*(W)$.
	So we compare $M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M g_2^*(W)$ with $M^0_\psi \times_M g_2^*(W)$.
	The rough idea of the remainder of the proof is to show that $\psi$ and $\phi g_2$ are both separating functions for $g_2^*(W)$ over $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$, which will allow us to invoke \cref{P: connecting}, though there remain some technicalities, including replacing $\psi$ with a slight modification.

	So, consider $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$. As $N = U \cup V$, we must have $M = g_2^{-1}(U) \cup g_2^{-1}(V)$.
	We have $g_2^{-1}(U) - g_2^{-1}(V) = g_2^{-1}(U  - V)$, so $\phi g_2(g_2^{-1}(U) - g_2^{-1}(V)) = \phi g_2(g_2^{-1}(U  - V)) \subset \phi(U  - V) = -1/2$, and similarly $\phi g_2(g_2^{-1}(V)  - g_2^{-1}(U)) = 1/2$.
	So $\phi g_2$ is a separating function on $M$ for $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$.
	We also know $M^0_{\phi g_2}$ is transverse to $g_2^*(W)$, so $\phi g_2$ separates $g_2^*(W)$ over $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$.

	As we chose $g_2$ so that $g_2 = g_1$ on $K$ and so that it takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,1/4])$ to $U$ and $\psi^{-1}([-1/4,1/2])$ to $V$, we have $g_2^{-1}(U  - V) \subset \psi^{-1}([-1/2,-1/4])$ and $g_2^{-1}(V  - U) \subset \psi^{-1}([1/4,1/2])$.
	Let $\psi_1$ be the composition of $\psi$ with a smooth non-decreasing map $a \colon [-1/2,1/2] \to [-1/2,1/2]$ such that:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $a([-1/2,-1/4]) = -1/2$,
		\item $a(x)=x$ on a neighborhood of $0$,
		\item $a([1/4,1/2]) = 1/2$.
	\end{enumerate}
	In this case, $M^0_\psi = M^0_{\psi_1}$, so we have $M^0_\psi \times_M g_2^*(W) = M^0_{\psi_1} \times_M g_2^*(W)$.
	Furthermore, as $g_2^{-1}(U) - g_2^{-1}(V) = g_2^{-1}(U - V)$, and similarly reversing the roles of $U$ and $V$, we see $\psi_1$ separates $g_2^*(W)$ over $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$.

	Lastly, we observe that $g_2^{-1}(U) \cup g_2^{-1}(V) = M$ and $g_2^{-1}(U) \cap g_2^{-1}(V) = g_2^{-1} (U \cap V) = g_2^{-1}(B)$, so $g_2$ maps this intersection into $B = U \cap V$.
	Therefore, the pullback $(g_2|_{g_2^{-1} (B)})^* (W)$ is an element of $PC^*_\Gamma(g_2^{-1} (B))$.
	But, $M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M	(g_2|_{g_2^{-1} (B)})^* (W) = M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M g_2^*(W)$ and $M^0_{\psi_1} \times_M (g_2|_{g_2^{-1} (B)})^* (W) = M^0_{\psi_1} \times_M g_2^*(W)$, as $M^0_{\phi g_2}$ and $M^0_{\psi_1}$ are both in $g_2^{-1} (B)$.
	Now, as desired, $M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M	(g_2|_{g_2^{-1} (B)})^* (W)$ and $M^0_{\psi_1} \times_M (g_2|_{g_2^{-1} (B)})^* (W)$ are two splittings of the same element of $PC^*_\Gamma(g_2^{-1} (B)) = PC^*_\Gamma(g_2^{-1}(U) \cap g_2^{-1}(V)) $ with respect to different separating functions over $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$, and so they represent the same element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$ by \cref{P: connecting}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	There exists a $g_2$ as claimed in the proof of \cref{T: natural connection}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	As $\psi^{-1}(\pm 1/4)$ are bicollared submanifolds of $M$, the submanifold $K \subset A$ is collared, so the inclusion map $K \into A$ is a cofibration, e.g. via\footnote{We define a map $M \to [0,1]$ as in the cited theorem by taking $K$ to $0$, projecting the parts of the collars isomorphic to $\psi^{-1}(\pm 1/4) \times [0,1]$ to the second factor, and taking everything else to $1$.} \cite[Theorem VII.1.5]{Bred97}.
	Therefore, the restriction to $K \times I$ of the homotopy from $f|_A$ to $g_1$ used at the start of the proof of \cref{T: natural connection} can be extended to a continuous homotopy $M \times I \to N$ from $f$ to a continuous map we will call $f' \colon M \to N$.
	So by construction, $f' = g_1$ on $K$.
	Furthermore, choosing the collars to be contained in $A$, which is an open neighborhood of $K$ in $M$, then by the usual construction of a homotopy extension using a neighborhood deformation retraction (see \cite[Section VII.1]{Bred97}), we can construct the homotopy such that we have a neighborhood $L$ of $K$ such that $f'$ takes $L$ to $B$ (because our homotopy of $f|_A$ maps to $B$) and so that $f' = f$ on $M - L$.
	In particular, $f'$ takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,1/4])$ to $U$ and $\psi^{-1}([-1/4,1/2])$ to $V$.

	From here, we will modify the proof of \cref{T: basic trans}.
	As in that argument, we suppose $N$ properly embedded as a closed manifold in some Euclidean space; then $N$ has a distance function inherited from Euclidean space, which we will denote $d$.

	First, on $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,-1/4])$, we consider the function $x \mapsto d(f'(x), V - U)$.
	As distance to a closed set is a continuous function and $f'$ takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,1/4])$ to $U$, this is a continuous function $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,-1/4]) \to (0,\infty)$.
	Similarly, $x \mapsto d(f'(x), U - V)$ is a positive function on $\psi^{-1}([1/4, 1/2])$.
	As $(0,\infty) \cong \R$, by the Tietze Extension Theorem we can extend these functions to a single function $\delta \colon M \to (0, \infty)$.
	We now apply smooth approximation\footnotemark to replace $f'$ with a homotopic function $g'$ that is smooth, such that $g' = f' = g_1$ on $K$, and such that $d(f'(x),g'(x))<\delta(x)/2$ for all $x \in M$.
	\footnotetext{A good proof that $f'$ is homotopic rel $K$ to a smooth map can be found in \cite[Theorem 6.26]{Lee13}. To obtain the distance bound, we modify the argument there to require that the function called $\td \delta$ in that proof satisfies $\td \delta(x) < \delta(x)/4$ in addition to the other requirements on $\td \delta$ in the proof. Noting that the tubular neighborhood in \cite{Lee13} is the same as an $\epsilon$-neighborhood in \cite{GuPo74}, we can now use a triangle inequality argument as in our proof of \cref{T: basic trans} to see that the smooth approximation satisfies $d(f'(x),g'(x))<\delta(x)/2$.}

	Next, we modify the transversality portion of the proof of \cref{T: basic trans} to obtain $g_2$ from $g'$.
	For the modification, we replace the smooth function $\eta$ in the definition of $H(x,s)$ with one that satisfies all the properties stated there except
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item we take $\eta(x)=0$ on $K$, and
		\item on $M - K$, we take $\eta(x) > 0$ and, in addition to its other size constraints, we take $\eta$ sufficiently small that $d(H(x,s),g'(x)) < \delta(x)/2$.
		This can be done using the same argument as in the proof of \cref{T: basic trans} for the case of proper maps, using $\delta/2$ in the role of $\varepsilon$ (that part of the argument did not rely on any map being proper).
	\end{enumerate}
	Then, continuing the transversality argument of \cref{T: basic trans}, $H(-,s)|_{M-K}$ is transverse to $W$ and $W^0$ for almost every $s \in D$, so we again choose such an $s_0$ and let $$h(x,t) = H(x, ts_0) = \pi(g'(x) + \eta(x)ts_0),$$ for all $x \in M$ and $t \in [0,1]$.
	Let $g_2 = h(-,1)$.

	Altogether now, $g_2$ is smooth, and it is equal to $g_1$ on $K$ by construction.
	It is transverse to $W$ and $W^0$ on $K$ because $g_1$ is, and it is transverse to $W$ and $W^0$ on $M - K$ by the argument from \cref{T: basic trans} with our choice of $s_0$.
	Finally, we see $g_2$ takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,1/4])$ to $U$ and $\psi^{-1}([-1/4,1/2])$ to $V$: On $K$, we have $g_2(K) = g_1(K) \subset B = U \cap V$ from the construction of $g_1$.
	For $x\in \psi^{-1}([-1/2,-1/4])$, our definition of the bounding function $\delta$ above and the choice of $\delta/2$-small homotopies in the steps from $f'$ to $g'$ and $g'$ to $g_2$ ensure that $d(f'(x), g_2(x)) < \delta(x)$, so $g_2(x)$ is a positive distance from $V - U$.
	Similarly for $\psi^{-1}([1/4,1/2])$ and $U - V$.
\end{proof}



\medskip

\noindent\textbf{The cohomology Mayer-Vietoris sequence.} We now come to the Mayer-Vietoris sequence itself.
The following observations and notation will be useful when working with the restriction maps.

Suppose $\uW \in H^*_\Gamma(M)$ represented by $r_W \colon W \to M$ and that $f \colon U \into M$ is the inclusion of an open subset.
As $f$ is smooth and necessarily transverse to $r_W$, we have $f^*(\uW)$ represented by the pullback $W \times_M U \to U$ by \cref{D: cohomology pullback and homology transfer}.	By \cref{P: codim 0 pullback}, this pullback is simply the restriction of $r_W$ to $r_W^{-1}(U)$.
In what follows, we will write the pullback $W \times_M U$ as $W|_U$, and the corresponding cohomology class, represented by $W|_U$, as $\uW|_U$.

\begin{theorem}\label{T: absolute MV}
	Let $U,V \subset M$ be open subsets.
	There is a long exact Mayer--Vietoris sequence
	\[
	\cdots \to H^k_\Gamma(U \cup V) \xr{i} H^k_\Gamma(U) \oplus H^k_\Gamma(V) \xr{j} H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V) \xr{\delta} H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U \cup V)\to\cdots
	\]
	with $i(\uW) = (\uW|_U, -\uW|_V)$, $j(\uW_1,\uW_2) = \uW_1|_{U \cap V}+\uW_2|_{U \cap V}$, and $\delta$ as given in \cref{D: connecting}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We first make some general observations that will apply throughout the proof.
	Notationally, we always assume $\uW$ is represented by $W$, etc.
	In the following, we typically assume an appropriate separating function $\phi \colon U \cup V \to [-1/2,1/2]$.
	We further assume $\phi$ has been chosen to separate any precochain under discussion;
	see \cref{D: separating function}.


	We observe that $(U \cap V)^+ = \phi^{-1}([0,1/2])\cap(U \cap V)$ is a closed subspace both of $U \cap V$ and of $U$, as $\phi^{-1}([0,1/2]) \cap (U \cap V) = \phi|_U^{-1}([0,1/2])$ given that $\phi(U - V) = -1/2$.
	So the inclusions $(U \cap V)^+ \into U \cap V$ and $(U \cap V)^+ \into U$ are both proper maps.
	Thus if $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$, in which case in particular $r_W \colon W \to U \cap V$ is proper, and assuming $\phi$ separates $W$ over $U$ and $V$, both the fiber products $(U \cap V)^+\times_{U \cap V} W \to U \cap V$ and $(U \cap V)^+\times_{U} W \to U$ will be proper maps.
	In fact, they both have the same domain, which is just $W^+$, and we will write $W^+$ for the corresponding elements of both $PC^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ or $PC^*_\Gamma(U)$, determining which is meant by context.
	Similarly, $W^-$ can represent an element of either $PC^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ or $PC^*_\Gamma(V)$.
	See \cref{F: MV1}.
	On the other hand, $(U \cap V)^- = \phi^{-1}([-1/2,0])\cap(U \cap V)$ is not generally closed in $U$, and so we do not obtain an element $W^-$ in $PC^*_\Gamma(U)$.
	Similarly, there is generally no $W^+$ in $PC^*_\Gamma(V)$.

	\begin{figure}[h]
		\input{auxy/mayer_vietoris1.tex}
		\caption{For a proper map $r_W \colon W \to U \cap V$, the restriction to $W^+$ is proper into $U$, while the restriction to $W^-$ is proper into $V$.}
		\label{F: MV1}
	\end{figure}

	Analogously, we have $\phi^{-1}([-1/2,0]) = \phi|_U^{-1}([-1/2,0])$, and so $\phi^{-1}([-1/2,0])$ is a closed subset of $U$ and of $U \cup V$.
	Therefore, the inclusions $\phi^{-1}([-1/2,0]) \into U$ and $\phi^{-1}([-1/2,0]) \into U \cup V$ are proper so that if $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(U)$, then $W^-$ can represent an element of either $PC^*_\Gamma(U)$ and $PC^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$.
	See \cref{F: MV2}.
	Likewise, if $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(V)$ then we obtain $W^+$ in both $PC^*_\Gamma(V)$ and $PC^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$.

	\begin{figure}[h]
		\input{auxy/mayer_vietoris2.tex}
		\caption{For a proper map $r_W \colon W \to U$, the restriction to $W^-$ is proper into $U \cup V$.}
		\label{F: MV2}
	\end{figure}

	We also note that $\phi^{-1}(0)$ is closed in $U \cap V$, $U$, $V$, and $U \cup V$, so if $W$ is an element of any of $PC_\Gamma^*(U \cap V)$, $PC_\Gamma^*(U)$, $PC_\Gamma^*(V)$, or $PC_\Gamma^*(U \cup V)$, then $W^0$ represents an element of all of these sets.

	Finally, let $A \subset B$ be any subsets of $M$, and suppose $W \xr{r_W} A$ and $r_W \xr{r_W} A \into B$ both represent precochains.
	Suppose further that $W \in Q^*(A)$; then also $W \in Q^*(B)$.
	This follows directly from the definitions, as being trivial or degenerate with image in $A$ implies being trivial or degenerate with image in $B$.

	These observations will all be used freely in the remainder of the proof, in which we proceed to consider exactness at each term of the sequence in turn.

	\textbf{Exactness at $\mathbf{H^k_\Gamma(U \cup V)}$.}
	Let $\uW \in H^{k-1}(U \cap V)$.
	Then $i\delta(\uW)$ is represented by $(-W^0|_U, W^0|_V)$.
	As $W^0$ already maps to $U \cap V$, we will write simply $(-W^0, W^0)$.
	By the above discussion, we have $W^+ \in PC^*_\Gamma(U)$, and by \cref{L: W0 cochain} as well as applying the discussion above to $(\bd W)^+$, we have $\bd (W^+) = W^0 \sqcup (\bd W)^+$ in $PC^*_\Gamma(U)$.
	Now $\bd W \in Q^*(U \cap V)$ as $W$ is a cocycle, so $(\bd W)^+ \in Q^*(U \cap V)$ by \cref{C: creasing Q} and so also $(\bd W)^+ \in Q^*(U)$ by the preceding discussion.
	Passing to cochains, we thus have $\bd (\underline{W^+}) = \underline{W^0}$ in $C^*_\Gamma(U)$, so $W^0$ represents $0 \in H^k_\Gamma(U)$.
	Similarly, $W^0$ represents $0 \in H^k_\Gamma(V)$ using $W^-$.
	So $i\delta = 0$.

	Next suppose $\uW \in H^k_\Gamma(U \cup V)$ with $i(\uW) = 0$.
	So $\uW|_U$ and $\uW|_V$ cobound in $U$ and $V$, respectively.
	By \cref{R: cycles and boundaries} there exists $A \in PC^*_\Gamma(U)$ with $\bd A \sqcup - W|_U \in Q^*(U)$ and $B \in PC^*_\Gamma(V)$ with $\bd B \sqcup - W|_V \in Q^*(V)$.
	We assume the separating function $\phi$ chosen so that it separates $W$, $A$, and $B$, considering each as mapping into $U \cup V$.
	Then $(\bd A \sqcup - W|_U)^- = (\bd A)^- \sqcup - (W|_U)^-$ is in $Q^*(U)$ by \cref{C: creasing Q}.
	By the above discussion, we can consider this equality holding in $PC^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$, where also $(W|_U)^- = W^-$.
	So $(\bd A)^- \sqcup - W^- \in Q^*(U \cup V)$.
	Similarly $(\bd B)^+ \sqcup - W^+ \in Q^*(U \cup V)$.

	Now by \cref{L: W0 cochain}, we have $\bd(A^-) = -A^0 \sqcup (\bd A)^-$ in $PC^*_\Gamma(U)$ and $\bd (B^+) = B^0 \sqcup (\bd B)^+$ in $PC^*_\Gamma(U)$.
	Again, we may consider both of these equalities holding in $PC^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$.
	So taking the disjoint union of $\bd(A^- \sqcup B^+)$ with $- W^- \sqcup - W^+$ and passing to $C^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\underline{	\bd(A^- \sqcup B^+) \sqcup - W^- \sqcup - W^+} &= \underline{-A^0 \sqcup (\bd A)^- \sqcup B^0 \sqcup (\bd B)^+ \sqcup - W^- \sqcup - W^+ }\\
		&= \underline{-A^0 \sqcup B^0 \sqcup (\bd A)^- \sqcup - W^- \sqcup (\bd B)^+ \sqcup - W^+ }\\
		&= \underline{-A^0 \sqcup B^0},
	\end{align*}
	as elements of $Q^*(U \cup V)$ represent $0$ in $C^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$.
	So
		\[	\bd (\underline{A^- \sqcup B^+}) = \underline{W^-} + \underline{W^+} -(\underline{A^0}-\underline{B^0}).\]
	But $\underline{W^-} + \underline{W^+}$ is cohomologous to $\uW$ in $U \cup V$ by creasing, \cref{T: cohomology creasing}, so $W$ is cohomologous to $\underline{A^0}-\underline{B^0}$, which represents $\delta(\underline{B}|_{U \cap V}-\underline{A}|_{U \cap V})$ in $H^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$.
	So $\uW \in H^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$ is in the image of $\delta$.

	\textbf{Exactness at $\mathbf{H^k_\Gamma(U) \oplus H^k_\Gamma(V)}$.}
	It is immediate that the composition $ji$ is the $0$ map.

	Suppose $(\uW_1,\uW_2) \in \ker j \subset H^k_\Gamma(U) \oplus H^k_\Gamma(V)$.
	Using representatives $W_1,W_2$, this means that there is a $Z \in C^k_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ with $\bd Z \sqcup - W_1|_{U \cap V} \sqcup - W_2|_{U \cap V} \in Q^*(U \cap V)$.
	We choose $\phi$ to separate $Z$, $W_1$, and $W_2$ over $U$ and $V$.
	We claim that $\gamma = W_1^- \sqcup -Z^0 \sqcup -W_2^+$ represents an element of $H^k_\Gamma(U \cup V)$ whose image under $i$ is $(\uW_1,\uW_2)$.
	We compute using \cref{L: W0 cochain}:
	\begin{align*}
	\bd \gamma& = \bd (W_1^- \sqcup - Z^0 \sqcup -W_2^+)\\
		& = -W_1^0 \sqcup (\bd W_1)^- \sqcup (\bd Z)^0 \sqcup - W_2^0 \sqcup - (\bd W_2)^+\\
		& = (\bd W_1)^- \sqcup - (\bd W_2)^+ \sqcup (\bd Z \sqcup -W_1 \sqcup - W_2)^0.
	\end{align*}
	As $W_1$ and $W_2$ are cycles in $U$ and $V$ respectively, $(\bd W_1)^-$ and $(\bd W_2)^+$ are in $Q^*(U)$ and $Q^*(V)$ by \cref{R: cycles and boundaries,C: creasing Q}, and so they are also in $Q^*(U \cup V)$ by our discussion above.
	We also know $\bd Z \sqcup - W_1|_{U \cap V} \sqcup - W_2|_{U \cap V} \in Q^*(U \cap V)$, so its splitting at $0$ is also in $Q^*(U \cap V)$ by \cref{C: creasing Q}; hence $(\bd Z \sqcup -W_1 \sqcup - W_2)^0 \in Q^*(U \cup V)$.
	So $\bd \gamma$ represents $0$ in $C^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$, and $\gamma$ represents an element of $H^k_\Gamma(U \cup V)$.

	Next we show that $\gamma|_U$ is cohomologous to $W_1$ in $U$.
	In fact, in $U$ we have
	\[\bd (Z^+) \sqcup \gamma|_U = Z^0 \sqcup (\bd Z)^+ \sqcup W_1^- \sqcup -Z^0 \sqcup -(W_2^+)|_U,\]
	using that $W_1^-$ and $Z^0$ are already precochains in both $U \cap V$ and $U$.
	So using \cref{L: W0 cochain}, passing to cochains, and undertaking some further manipulations, we have in $C^*_\Gamma(U)$ that
	\begin{align*}
	\bd (\underline{Z^+}) + \underline{\gamma}|_U &
		= \underline Z^0 + \underline{(\bd Z)^+} + \underline{W_1^-} - \underline Z^0 -\underline{W_2^+}|_U + (\underline{W_1^+} - \underline{W_1^+})\\
		&= \underline{(\bd Z)^+} + \underline{W_1^-} -\underline{W_2^+}|_U + \underline{W_1^+} - \underline{W_1^+}\\
		&= \underline{(\bd Z \sqcup - W_1|_{U \cap V} \sqcup - W_2|_{U \cap V})^+} + \underline{W_1^-} + \underline{W_1^+}\\
		&=\underline{W_1^-} + \underline{W_1^+}\\
		&=\underline{W_1}.
	\end{align*}
	Here we have used that $\bd Z \sqcup - W_1|_{U \cap V} \sqcup - W_2|_{U \cap V} \in Q^*(U \cap V)$, which implies that it is also in \cref{C: creasing Q},
	and that $\underline{W_1^-} + \underline{W_1^+}= \underline{W_1}$ in $H^*_\Gamma(U)$ by creasing, \cref{T: cohomology creasing}.
	So $\underline{W_1} = \underline{\gamma}|_U \in H^*_\Gamma(U)$, as claimed.

	Similarly, in $V$ we have
	\begin{align*}
	\bd (\underline{Z^-}) - \underline{\gamma}|_V &
		= - \underline Z^0 + \underline{(\bd Z)^-} - \underline{W_1^-}|_V + \underline Z^0 +\underline{W_2^+} + (\underline{W_2^-} - \underline{W_2^-})\\
		&= \underline{(\bd Z)^-} - \underline{W_1^-}|_V + \underline{W_2^+} + \underline{W_2^-} - \underline{W_2^-}\\
		&= \underline{(\bd Z \sqcup - W_1|_{U \cap V} \sqcup - W_2|_{U \cap V})^-} + \underline{W_2^-} + \underline{W_2^+}\\
		&=\underline{W_2^-} + \underline{W_2^+}\\
		&=\underline{W_2}.
	\end{align*}
	So $\underline{W_2} = -\underline{\gamma}|_V$ in $H^*_\Gamma(V)$.


	Altogether, we have $(\uW_1,\uW_2) = \left(\underline{\gamma}|_U, -\underline{\gamma}|_V\right) = i\left(\underline{\gamma}\right)$.

	\textbf{Exactness at $\mathbf{H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V)}$.}
	Consider a cocycle $W$ in $C^k_\Gamma(U)$.
	Then $\delta j(\uW)$ is represented by $-W^0$.
	By the discussion above, $W^- \in PC^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$, and $$\bd (W^-) = -W^0 \sqcup (\bd W)^-.$$ As $W$ is a cocycle, $\bd W \in Q^*(U)$, and so $(\bd W)^-$ is in $Q^*(U)$ and $Q^*(U \cup V)$ via \cref{C: creasing Q} and the preceding discussion.
	So $\bd (\underline{W^-}) = - \underline{W^0}$ in $C^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$, and consequently
 $\delta j(\uW) = 0 \in H^*_\Gamma(U \cup V)$.
	A similar argument holds for elements of $H^k_\Gamma(V)$.

	Now suppose $\uW \in H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ and $\delta(\uW) = 0$.
	Representing $\uW$ by $W$, this means there is a $Z$ in $U \cup V$ such that $\bd Z \sqcup W^0 \in Q^*(U \cup V)$.
	Let $A = Z|_U \sqcup W^+ \in PC^*_\Gamma(U)$ and $B = -Z|_V \sqcup W^- \in PC^*_\Gamma(V)$.
	Then by \cref{L: W0 cochain},
	\begin{align*}
		\bd A& = \phantom{-}\bd Z|_U \sqcup \bd( W^+) = \phantom{-}\bd Z|_U \sqcup \phantom{-} W^0 \sqcup (\bd W)^{+} \in PC^*_\Gamma(U)\\
		\bd B& = -\bd Z|_V \sqcup \bd (W^-) = -\bd Z|_V \sqcup -W^0 \sqcup (\bd W)^{-} \in PC^*_\Gamma(V).
	\end{align*}
	As $\bd Z \cup W^0 \in Q^*(U \cup V)$, its restrictions to $U$ and $V$ are in $Q^*(U)$ and $Q^*(V)$, respectively, by \cref{L: pullback map Q}.
	Furthermore, as $W$ represents a cocycle, $\bd W \in Q^*(U \cap V)$, so $(\bd W)^\pm \in Q^*(U\cap V)$ by \cref{C: creasing Q} and consequently $(\bd W)^+$ and $(\bd W)^-$ are in $Q^*(U)$ and $Q^*(V)$, respectively.
	So by \cref{R: cycles and boundaries}, the pair $(A,B)$ represents an element of $H^k_\Gamma(U) \oplus H^k_\Gamma(V)$.

	We then have in $C^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ that
	\begin{align*}
		j(\underline{A}, \underline{B})& = \underline{A}|_{U \cap V} + \underline{B}|_{U \cap V}\\
		& = \underline{Z}|_{U \cap V}+ \underline{W^+} - \underline{Z}|_{U \cap V} + \underline{W^-}\\
		& = \underline{W^+} + \underline{W^-}.
	\end{align*}
	The cochain $\underline{W^+} + \underline{W^-}$ represents $\uW \in H^*_\Gamma(U \cap V)$ via creasing, \cref{T: cohomology creasing}, so $\uW \in \im(j)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[Cohomology of spheres]\label{E: cohomology of spheres}
Analogous to our observation about homology of spheres in \cref{E: sphere homology}, once one has a dimension axiom (\cref{E: dimension}), homotopy invariance, and Mayer-Vietoris sequences, the geometric cohomology groups of spheres follow from formal computations, and we have $H^0_{\Gamma}(S^n)\cong H^n_\Gamma(S^n)\cong \Z$ with all other cohomology groups zero.
For $n>0$, by \cref{E: sphere homology} and our strong form of Poincar\'e duality in \cref{T: PD}, $H^0_{\Gamma}(S^n)$ is generated by the class of $\id \colon S^n \to S^n$ and $H^n_{\Gamma}(S^n)$ is generated by the class of the inclusion of a point, each with either co-orientation.

We can also see this by induction, again analogously to the arguments in \cref{E: sphere homology}, but with some interesting geometric differences. Let us start with $n>1$ and write $S^n$ again as the union of open disks $U$ and $V$ that extend the hemispheres. Then the Mayer-Vietoris sequence starts out as
\begin{equation*}
0\to H^0_\Gamma(S^n) \to H^0_\Gamma(U) \oplus H^0_\Gamma(V) \to H^0_\Gamma(U\cap V) \to H^1_\Gamma(S^n) \to H^1_\Gamma(U) \oplus H^1_\Gamma(V) \to.
\end{equation*}
The extended hemispheres $U$ and $V$ are contractible and so by \cref{E: contractible} the only nontrivial cohomology of each is $H^0_\Gamma(U) \cong H^0_\Gamma(V) \cong \Z$, in each case generated by the class of the tautologically co-oriented identity map.
The tautologically co-oriented identity map $\id_{S^n} \colon S^n \to S^n$ thus represents an element of $H^0_\Gamma(S^n)$ that restricts to generators of $H^0_\Gamma(U)$ and $H^0_\Gamma(V)$.
Furthermore, the identity maps of $U$ and $V$ each restrict to the identity map $\id_{U \cap V} \colon U \cap V \to U \cap V$.
But $U \cap V \cong S^{n-1} \times (-1,1)$, so if we assume inductively that $H^0_\Gamma(S^{n-1}) \cong \Z$ with the generator represented by the identity $\id_{S^{n-1}}$, then by \cref{E: contractible} the map $\id_{U \cap V}$ generates $H^0_\Gamma(U \cap V) \cong \Z$.
As $H^1_\Gamma(U) = H^1_\Gamma(V) = 0$, it follows that $H^1_\Gamma(S^1) = 0$ and $H^0_\Gamma(S^n) \cong \Z$, generated by $\id_{S^n}$.

Continuing to assume $n>1$ and that we know $H^*_\Gamma(S^{n-1})$, all $H^i_\Gamma(S^n)$ for $i>0$ must be zero from the long exact sequence until we reach degree $n$, where the Mayer-Vietoris sequence collapses to the isomorphism $H^{n-1}_\Gamma(U \cap V) \xr{\delta} H^n_\Gamma(S^n)$.
If we assume inductively that $H^{n-1}_\Gamma(S^{n-1}) \cong \Z$ is generated by the inclusion of a point $f \colon pt \into S^{n-1}$, then, by \cref{E: contractible}, if we identify $U \cap V$ again with $S^{n-1} \times (-1,1)$ we have $H^{n-1}_\Gamma(U \cap V) \cong H^{n-1}_\Gamma(S^{n-1} \times (-1,1))\cong \Z$ generated by $f \times \id_{(-1,1)}$.
We can choose a separating function $\phi$ so that $\phi^{-1}(0) = S^{n-1} \times 0 \subset S^n$.
Then by the definition of $\delta$ in \cref{D: connecting}, the image of this generator in $H^n_\Gamma(S^n)$ is represented up to sign by the composition $f \times \id_{0} \colon pt \times 0 \to S^{n-1} \times (-1,1) \into S^n$.

The base case $n=1$ is again a bit more complicated and left as a good exercise for the reader.

	\subsection{The suspension map and the cohomology of Euclidean space}\label{S: suspension}

	\red{I'm leaving it for now, but I'm not sure we need this section anymore (which is a shame as I enjoyed writing it).}

	\begin{proposition}
		$H_\Gamma^*(\R^n) \cong H^*(\R^n)$.
	\end{proposition}

	The proof of the proposition will proceed by an induction over the dimension $n$.
	For $n = 0$, the domains of all cochains must be compact and oriented, so $H^*_\Gamma(\R^0) = H_*^\Gamma(\R^0)$, where the latter represents Lipyanskiy's geometric homology theory, which is isomorphic to singular homology by \cite[Section 10]{Lipy14} (or in this case by direct computation).
	For $n>0$, our general strategy will be derived from the treatment of non-compactly supported piecewise-linear intersection homology in \cite[Section II.2]{BoHab}.
	In particular, we have the following two lemmas modifying \cite[Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3]{BoHab}.

	\begin{lemma}
		Let $M$ be a manifold, and suppose $\uW \in C^{i}_\Gamma(\R \times M)$ is a cocycle with support in $\R_+ \times M$.
		Then $\uW$ is the coboundary of a cochain in $C^{i-1}_\Gamma(\R \times M)$ supported in $\R_+ \times M$.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $p_1 \colon \R \times M \to \R$ and $p_2 \colon \R \times M \to M$ be the projections, and let $r_W \colon W \to \R_+ \times M$ be the reference map.
		Note that $\R_+ \times W$ is a manifold with corners by \cite[Theorem 6.4]{Joy12}.
		So we can define a new map $r_{\R_+ \times W} \colon \R_+ \times W \to \R \times M$ by $r_{\R_+ \times W}(t,x) = (t+p_1r_W(x),p_2r_W(x))$.
		As $r_W$ is proper, so is $r_{\R_+ \times W}$, and its boundary (up to signs) is the sum of $W$ with $\pm r_{\R_+ \times \bd W} \colon \R_+ \times \bd W \to \R \times M$, letting this latter map be constructed analogously to $r_{\R_+ \times W}$.
		As $\bd W$ represents $0$ in $C^*_\Gamma(\R \times W)$, it must be a sum of trivial and degenerate objects.
		But it is easy to see that our construction takes trivial and degenerate objects to trivial and degenerate objects, respectively, so that $\R_+ \times \bd W$ is a sum of trivial and degenerate objects.
		Thus $W$ cobounds as required.
	\end{proof}

	In this section we give an explicit construction of the cohomology suspension isomorphism

	\begin{proposition}[Suspension isomorphism]
		Define the suspension map\footnote{Note that the suspension map $S$ has degree $0$ as the degree of an element of $W$ is determined by the codimension $\dim(M)-\dim(W)$, which is preserved under suspension.
		} $S:PC^*_\Gamma(M) \to PC^{*}_\Gamma(\R \times M)$ so that if $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ is represented by $r_W \colon W \to M$ then $S(W)$ is represented by $r_{\R \times W} \colon \R \times W \to \R \times M$ defined by $r_{\R \times W}(t,x) = (t,r_W(x))$.
		Then $S$ induces isomorphisms $S \colon H^*_\Gamma(M) \to H^{*}_\Gamma(M)$.
	\end{proposition}
	\begin{proof}
		We first observe that $S$ descends to a well-defined map $C^*_\Gamma(M) \to C^{*}_\Gamma(\R \times M)$, as it is easy to see that it preserves the properties of being trivial or degenerate.
		It is also clearly a chain map.

		Next, we note that $S: C^*_\Gamma(M) \to C^{*}_\Gamma(M)$ is injective: In order for $\R \times W$ to be trivial, each $\{t\} \times W$ would have to be trivial so that $W$ would be trivial, and similarly in order for $\R \times W$ to be degenerate, $W$ would have to be degenerate.
		Thus it suffices to show that the quotient of $C^{*}_\Gamma(M)$ by the image of $C^*_\Gamma(M)$ is acyclic.
		To do so, we must show that if $\uW \in C^{*}_\Gamma(M)$ and $\bd W = S(V)+T$ for some $V \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ and $T \in Q^*(M)$ then $W = \bd Z+S(V')+T'$ for some $V' \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ and $T' \in Q^*(M)$.

		Consider the map $p \colon \R \times M \to \R$.
		The composite $pr_W$ must have a regular value by Sard's theorem; without loss of generality, we assume this is at $0$.
		As in the creasing construction, let $W_0 = (pr_W)^{-1}(0)$, $W^+ = (pr_W)^{-1}([0,\infty))$, and $W^- = (pr_W)^{-1}((-\infty,0])$.
		We can also think of these as the pullbacks $p^{-1}(0) \times_M W$, etc.
		Similarly, we consider $S(W_0)$ and note that it has an analogous creasing decomposition with $(S(W_0))_0 = W_0$, $S(W_0)^+ = \R_+ \times W_0$, and $S(W_0)^- = \R_- \times W_0$.
		We will also need to consider $\bd (W_0)$.
		From the properties of pullbacks \cite[Proposition 7.4]{Joy12} (from which we get the sign in the following formula using that $W_0 = p^{-1}(0) \times_M W$), we have
		$$\bd(W_0) = -(\bd W)_0 = -S(V+T)_0 = -S(V)_0-T_0 = -V-T_0.$$

		%p^{-1}((-infty,0]) \times_M W

		Next, we consider $W^--(\R_- \times W_0)$.
		Its boundary, again using the sign conventions from Joyce, is
		\begin{align*}
			\bd (W^--(\R_- \times W_0))& = \bd(W^-)-\bd (\R_- \times W_0) \\
			& = [W_0+(S(V)+T)^- ]-[W_0-\R_- \times \bd W_0]\\
			& = (\R_- \times V)+T^-+(\R_- \times \bd W_0)\\
			& = (\R_- \times V)+T^-+(\R_- \times (-V-T_0))\\
			& = (\R_- \times V)+T^--(\R_- \times V)-(\R_- \times T_0)\\
			& = T^--(\R_- \times T_0).
		\end{align*}
		As $T$ is an element of $Q^*(\R \times M)$ and $T^-$ and $T_0$ are pullbacks of $T$ with other precochains, they are also in $Q^*(\R \times M)$ by REF.
		It follows that $\R_- \times T_0$ is also in $Q^*(\R \times M)$, so
		$W^--(\R_- \times W_0)$ is a cocycle in $C_\Gamma^*(\R \times M)$ that is supported in $\R_- \times M$.
		By the preceding lemma, it cobounds, i.e.\ there is a $Z_1$ with $\bd Z_1 = W^--(\R_- \times W_0)+A_1$, with $A_1 \in Q^*(\R \times M)$.

		Analogously, there are $Z_2$ and $A_2$ such that $\bd Z_2 = W^+-(\R_+ \times W_0)+A_2$.

		We now consider the cochain $\Cre(W)-\Cre(S(W_0))-Z_1-Z_2$.
		Its boundary is
		\begin{align*}
			\bd(\Cre(W)&-\Cre(S(W_0))-Z_1-Z_2)\\
			& = W^++W^--W-\Cre(\bd W)-[(\R_+ \times W_0)+(\R_- \times W_0)-S(W_0)-\Cre(\bd S(W_0))] \\
			&\phantom{ = } -W^-+(\R_- \times W_0)-A_1-W^++(\R_+ \times W_0)-A_2\\
			& = -W+S(W_0)-\Cre(\bd W)+\Cre(\bd S(W_0))-A_1-A_2
		\end{align*}

		Now recall that $\bd W = S(V)+T$, while $\bd S(W_0) = \bd(\R \times W_0) = -\R \times \bd W_0 = -S(\bd W_0) = -S(-V-T_0) = S(V+T_0)$.
		So $\Cre(\bd W)-\Cre(\bd S(W_0)) = \Cre(T)-\Cre(S(T_0))$.
		We already know $A_1,A_2 \in Q^*(\R \times M)$.
		Furthermore, $\Cre(T), \Cre(S(T_0)) \in Q^*(\R \times M)$ as we have noted that the suspension of an element of $Q^*(M)$ is in $Q^*(\R \times M)$ and the creasing of an element of $Q^*(\R \times M)$ is in $Q^*(\R \times M)$ by the proof of \cite[Lemma 18]{Lipy14}.

		So, we have established a cohomology between $W$ and $S(W_0)$ as desired.
	\end{proof}

\subsection{Geometric homology and cohomology are singular homology and cohomology}\label{S: homology is homology}

In this section, we apply a theorem of Kreck and Singhof to show that geometric homology and cohomology are isomorphic to singular homology and cohomology on smooth manifolds.

\begin{theorem}\label{T: geometric is singular}
	On the category of smooth manifolds (without boundary) and continuous maps, geometric homology and cohomology are respectively isomorphic to singular homology and cohomology with integer coefficients, i.e.\ $H_*^\Gamma(-) \cong H_*(- ;\Z)$ and $H^*_\Gamma(-) \cong H^*(-;\Z)$ as functors.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	This is a consequence of \cite[Proposition 10]{Krec10b} once we verify that $H_*^\Gamma$ and $H^*_\Gamma$ are respectively an ordinary homology theory and an ordinary cohomology theory on the category of smooth manifolds and continuous maps as defined in \cite{Krec10b}.
	Putting together the definitions and axioms of Sections 4 and 5 of \cite{Krec10b}, we must show the following:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item\label{I: homotopy functor} $H_*^\Gamma$ is a covariant homotopy functor on the category of smooth manifolds (without boundary) and continuous maps between them, and $H^*_\Gamma$ is a contravariant homotopy functor on the same category.

		\item For each triple $(M;U,V)$ with $M$ a smooth manifold and $U,V$ open subsets there are exact (homological or cohomological) Mayer--Vietoris sequences with natural connecting maps $\delta$.

		\item\label{I: neg dim} For all $M$, $H_k^\Gamma(M) = H^k_\Gamma(M) = 0$ for $k<0$.

		\item The Dimension Axiom: $H_k^\Gamma(pt) = H^k_\Gamma(pt) = 0$ for $k\neq 0$.

		\item $H_*^\Gamma$ and $H^*_\Gamma$ are additive: for a manifold $M$ of dimension $0$, each $H_k^\Gamma(M)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\oplus_{x \in M} H_k^\Gamma(x)$ and each $H^k_\Gamma(M)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\prod_{x \in M} H^k_\Gamma(x)$.
	\end{enumerate}

	Axiom \ref{I: homotopy functor} holds from the definitions, \cref{T: homology homotopy functor,P: cohomology pullback,C: contra funct}.
	We have Mayer--Vietoris sequences by \cref{T: relative MV,T: absolute MV}.
	The connecting map for the cohomology sequence is natural by \cref{T: natural connection}.
	The connecting map for the homology sequence is natural just as in the standard argument for singular homology: given a map of triples $(M;U',V') \to (N;U,V)$ there is a map of Mayer--Vietoris sequences induced by a map of short exactly sequences of chain complexes of the form of diagram \eqref{E: homology MV SES} (replacing supported cochain complexes with chain complexes), itself induced by functoriality from the maps of chain complexes $C_*^{\Gamma}(U') \to C_*^{\Gamma}(U)$ and similarly for $V$ and $U \cap V$.
	The resulting map of Mayer--Vietoris sequences shows that the connecting map is natural.

	Axiom \ref{I: neg dim} holds trivially for homology as there are no non-empty prechains of degree $<0$.
	It also holds for cohomology because for $k<0$ any representing precocycle must have small rank and its boundary must be in $Q^*(M)$ by \cref{R: cycles and boundaries}.
	Thus such a precocycle is degenerate and must represent $0 \in C^k_\Gamma(M)$.

	The Dimension Axiom has been proven in \cref{E: dimension}.

	The Additivity Axiom is apparent.

	As $H_*^\Gamma$ and $H^*_\Gamma$ satisfy all the axioms, \cite[Proposition 10]{Krec10b} says that for any isomorphism $H_0(pt) \xr{\cong} H^\Gamma_0(pt)$ there is a unique isomorphism of homology theories $H_*(- ;\Z) \xr{\cong} H_*^\Gamma(-)$, and similarly for cohomology.
	As we know that $H_0^\Gamma(pt) \cong H_\Gamma^0(pt) \cong \Z$ by \cref{E: dimension}, our theorem follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
	Let us consider $H^*_\Gamma(\R P^2)$.
	We know from the standard computations of $H^*(\R P^2)$ and the above theorem that
	\begin{equation*}
		H_\Gamma^i(\R P^2) =
		\begin{cases}
			\Z_2,&i = 2,\\
			\Z,&i = 0,\\
			0,&\text{otherwise.}
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
	From the viewpoint of geometric cohomology, $H^0(\R P^2)$ is generated by the identity map $\R P^2 \to \R P^2$ with its tautological co-orientation.

	In degree $1$, cochains are represented by co-oriented maps from (unions of) closed intervals or circles.
	For a map from the circle to be co-oriented it cannot represent the non-trivial element $\alpha \in \pi_1(\R P^2)$, and so it must be contractible.
	Any map from a disk must be co-orientable, as the disk is contractible (this can be considered an extension of \cref{L: co-orientable homotopies}).
	Thus by smooth approximation, any smooth co-oriented map from the circle to $\R P^2$ is the boundary of a smooth co-oriented map from the disk, and so represents $0$ in cohomology.
	The same is true for any circle decomposed into intervals that does not represent $\alpha \in \pi_2(\R P^2)$; via homotopy and creasing, such a ``circle'' is the boundary of a polygon.
	On the other hand, consider a map $g \colon [0,1] \to \R P^2$ that does represent $\alpha$.
	As $[0,1]$ is contractible, such a map can always be co-oriented.
	We can let $e$ represent the standard unit vector of $[0,1]$ and suppose that $g$ is co-oriented so that at $0 \in [0,1]$ the co-orientation is represented by $(e,\beta)$ for some local orientation $\beta$ of $\R P^2$ at $g(0)$.
	Traversing the path, the representation for the co-orientation at $1$ is then $(e,-\beta)$.
	Recalling our boundary conventions, the boundary of $g$ therefore consists of the maps $g|_0:0 \to \R P^2$ co-oriented by $(1,e)*(e,\beta) = (1,\beta)$ and $g|_1:1 \to \R P^2$ co-oriented by $(1,-e)*(e,-\beta) = (1,\beta)$.
	Thus with these co-orientations, $g|_0:0 \to \R P^2$ and $g|_1:1 \to \R P^2$ represent isomorphic manifolds over $\R P^2$.
	So $g$ does not represent a cocycle.
	On the other hand, as a co-oriented map from any single point to $\R P^2$ is a $2$-cocycle, this shows that by choosing the image to be the basepoint for $\pi_1(\R P^2)$ that twice any such map is a boundary.
	We leave it to the reader to verify that any two such points generate the same cohomology class and that a map from a single point cannot represent a coboundary, and so we have verified that $H^1_\Gamma(\R P^2) = 0$ and $H_\Gamma^2(\R P^2) \cong \Z_2$.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{A more direct comparison of singular and geometric homology}\label{S: homology direct}

While \cref{T: geometric is singular} says that geometric homology and cohomology are isomorphic to singular homology and cohomology, it does not provide actual isomorphisms, which we would like to have.
In this section, we provide a second proof that singular and geometric homology are isomorphic, in this case providing the isomorphism.
We will consider the case of cohomology in \cref{S: transversality}.

The basic idea for homology is that, as simplices are manifolds with corners and as the standard model simplex comes equipped with an orientation, smooth singular simplices are geometric chains.
In other words, if we let $S^{sm}_*(M)$ denote the chain complex of smooth singular chains on the manifold without boundary $M$, then the generators, which are smooth singular simplices $\sigma \colon \Delta^i \to M$, are prechains, and so they represent elements of $C_*^\Gamma(M)$.
As $S^{sm}_*(M)$ is freely generated by the smooth singular simplices, this determines a map of graded abelian groups $S^{sm}_*(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$.
We will see that there is consistency of the boundary orientations so that this is a chain map $S^{sm}_*(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$.
We will show that it is, in fact, a quasi-isomorphism, i.e.\ it induces isomorphisms of homology groups.
Combined with the well-known fact that the inclusion $S^{sm}_*(M) \into S_*(M)$ is a chain homotopy equivalence if $S_*(M)$ is the full singular chain complex on $M$ \cite[Theorem 18.7]{Lee13}, this will provide a concrete chain of isomorphisms $H_*(M) \cong H_*^\Gamma(M)$.

It will be useful in what follows to have the analogous result for cubical singular homology in addition to the more common simplicial singular homology.
Details of cubical singular homology can be found, for example, in \cite{Mas91} or \cite[Section 8.3]{HW60}, though we provide a brief overview.

Rather than maps of simplices $\Delta^k \to M$, the cubical singular chain complex, which we denote $SK_*(M)$, is generated by maps $\interval^k \to M$ with $\interval$ being the standard interval $\interval = [0,1]$ (it will be convenient henceforth to use this notation for the interval in this context).
The boundary formula is defined so that if $\sigma: \interval^k \to M$ is a singular cube, then
\begin{equation}\label{E: cube bd}
	\bd \sigma = \sum_{i = 1}^k (-1)^i(\sigma \delta_i^0-\sigma \delta^1_i),
\end{equation}
where for $\epsilon\in\{0,1\}$, the map $\delta_i^\epsilon \colon \interval^{k-1} \to \interval^k$ is defined by
$$\delta_i^\epsilon(x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1}) = (x_1,\ldots,\epsilon,\ldots, x_k)$$
with $\epsilon$ in the $i$th slot.
The homology of the chain complex $SK_*(M)$ is not isomorphic to singular homology, as it does not satisfy the dimension axiom, so one instead forms the normalized complex $NK_*(M)$ by quotienting out the subcomplex of \textit{degenerate singular cubes} that is generated by singular cubes $\sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$ such that $\sigma$ does not depend on at least one of the variables.
In other words, the degenerate singular cubes are those maps $\sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$ that factor through one of the coordinate projections $\interval^k \to \interval^{k-1}$.
It then holds that $NK_*(M)$ is chain homotopy equivalent to $S_*(M)$, the complex of singular simplicial chains.
In fact, this holds for $M$ any space and not just a manifold \cite[Theorem 8.4.7]{HW60}.
Of course we will need the smooth version $NK^{sm}_*(M)$ generated by smooth singular cubes and modulo degenerate smooth singular cubes.
We defer to an appendix to this section the proof that $NK^{sm}_*(M) \into NK_*(M)$ is a chain homotopy equivalence.

As the cubes $\interval^k$ are compact manifolds with corners equipped with their standard orientations,
we have, analogously to the simplicial case, maps $SK^{sm}_i(M) \to C_i^\Gamma(M)$ for each $i$.
We will show that this is a chain map and that it induces a chain map $NK^{sm}_*(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$.




\begin{comment}
The basic ideas is that, as simplices are manifolds with corners and as the standard model simplex comes equipped with an orientation, if we let $S^{sm}_*(M)$ denote the chain complex of smooth singular chains on the manifold without boundary $M$, there is an inclusion map of sets $S^{sm}_*(M) \into PC_*^\Gamma(M)$.
To handle coefficients, an expression of the form $k \sigma \in S^{sm}_*(M)$ with $0 \neq k \in \Z$ and $\sigma$ a singular simplex corresponds to the disjoint union of $|k|$ isomorphic copies of $\sigma$ or $-\sigma$, according to the sign of $k$.
Of course sums in $S^{sm}_*(M)$ correspond to disjoint unions in $PC_*^\Gamma(M)$.
We will see that there is consistency of the boundary orientations so that this induces a chain map $S^{sm}_*(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$.
We will show that this is a quasi-isomorphism, i.e.\ it induces isomorphisms of homology groups.
Combined with the well-known fact that the inclusion $S^{sm}_*(M) \into S_*(M)$ is a chain homotopy equivalence if $S_*(M)$ is the full singular chain complex on $M$ \cite[Theorem 18.7]{Lee13}, this will provide a concrete chain of isomorphisms $H_*(M) \cong H_*^\Gamma(M)$.

It will be useful in what follows to have the analogous result for cubical singular homology in addition to the more common simplicial singular homology.
Details of cubical singular homology can be found, for example, in \cite{Mas91} or \cite[Section 8.3]{HW60}, though we provide a brief overview.

Rather than maps of simplices $\Delta^k \to M$, the cubical singular chain complex, which we denote $SK_*(M)$, is generated by maps $\interval^k \to M$ with $\interval$ being the standard interval $\interval = [0,1]$ (it will be convenient henceforth to use this notation for the interval).
The boundary formula is defined so that if $\sigma: \interval^k \to M$ is a singular cube, then
\begin{equation}\label{E: cube bd}
	\bd \sigma = \sum_{i = 1}^k (-1)^i(\sigma \delta_i^0-\sigma \delta^1_i),
\end{equation}
where for $\epsilon\in\{0,1\}$, the map $\delta_i^\epsilon \colon \interval^{k-1} \to \interval^k$ is defined by
$$\delta_i^\epsilon(x_1,\ldots,x_k) = (x_1,\ldots,\epsilon,\ldots, x_k)$$
with $\epsilon$ in the $i$th slot.
The homology of the chain complex $SK_*(M)$ is not isomorphic to singular homology, as it does not satisfy the dimension axiom, so one instead forms the normalized complex $NK_*(M)$ by quotienting out the subcomplex of degenerate singular cubes, generated by singular cubes $\sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$ such that $\sigma$ does not depend on at least one of the variables.
In other words, the degenerate singular cubes are those maps $\sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$ that factor through one of the coordinate projections $\interval^k \to \interval^{k-1}$.
It then holds that $NK_*(M)$ is chain homotopy equivalent to $S_*(M)$, the complex of singular simplicial chains.
In fact, this holds for $M$ any space and not just a manifold \cite[Theorem 8.4.7]{HW60}.
Of course we will need the smooth version $NK^{sm}_*(M)$ generated by smooth singular cubes and modulo degenerate smooth singular cubes.
We defer to an appendix to this section the proof that $NK^{sm}_*(M) \into NK_*(M)$ is a chain homotopy equivalence.

As the cubes $\interval^k$ are compact manifolds with corners equipped with their standard orientations,
we have, analogously to the simplicial case, a set inclusion $SK^{sm}_i(M) \into PC_i^\Gamma(M)$ for each $i$.
\end{comment}

\begin{lemma}\label{L: singular and cubical chain maps}
	The maps $S^{sm}_*(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$ and $SK^{sm}_*(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$ are well-defined chain maps.
	The latter induces a chain map $NK^{sm}_*(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We first consider the simplicial case, for which we need only verify that our boundary orientation convention for manifolds with corners is consistent with the simplicial boundary formula.

	We will think of the model $k$-simplex $\Delta^k$ as being the convex hull in $\R^k$ of the origin and the points $(0, \ldots , 1, \ldots, 0)$ as the $1$ varies through the $k$ coordinates.
	We will also use the abstract simplicial notation $[0,\ldots,k]$ when convenient, identifying the vertex $0$ with the origin and the vertex $i$ with the point $(0, \ldots , 1, \ldots, 0)$ with $1$ in the $i$th place.
	Then, letting $e_i$ denote the $i$th standard unit basis vector, the standard orientation of $\Delta^k$ is $e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_k$.
	The simplicial boundary formula, written in terms of manifolds with corners, is then
	\[\bd [0,\ldots,k] = \amalg_i (-1)^i [0,\ldots, \hat i,\ldots, k].\]
	Let $F_i$ denote the face $[0,\ldots, \hat i,\ldots, k]$.
	We first consider the $F_i$ for $i > 0$.
	In this case, the vector $-e_i$ can be taken as our outward pointing normal to $F_i$ and the remaining $e_j$ are in the tangent space to $F_i$.
	So, by definition, the boundary orientation $\beta_i$ of $F_i$ as a manifold with corners boundary is the one such that $-e_i \wedge \beta_i$ agrees with $e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_k$.
	We observe that
	\[ -e_i \wedge e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \hat e_i \wedge \cdots \wedge e_k = (-1)^ie_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_k,\]
	so $\beta_i = (-1)^i e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \hat e_i \wedge \cdots \wedge e_k$.
	Thus the corresponding simplicial boundary term is $(-1)^i [0,\ldots, \hat i,\ldots, k]$, as desired, observing that the standard simplicial orientation of $[0,\ldots, \hat i,\ldots, k]$ is $e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \hat e_i \wedge \cdots \wedge e_k$.
	Now, we consider $F_0$.
	For $2\leq j\leq k$, let $w_j$ be the vector from the vertex $(1,0,\ldots,0)$ to the $j$th vertex of $\Delta^k$.
 	These $w_j$ span the tangent space of $F_0$, and the simplicial orientation of $F_0$ is $w_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k$.
	Taking $e_1$ to be an outward pointing normal at $F_0$, the orientation $\beta_0$ of $F_0$ as a manifold with corners boundary is the one such that $e_1 \wedge \beta_0 = e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_k$.
	But now we observe that projection to the $x_1 = 0$ plane takes $w_j$ to $e_j$, which is sufficient to conclude that $e_1 \wedge w_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k = e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_k$, so $\beta_0 = w_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k$, and this corresponds simplicially to $[1,\ldots, k]$, as desired in the simplicial boundary formula.

	We turn now to cubes.

	Any degenerate singular cube $\sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$ is also degenerate as a prechain in the sense of \cref{D: equiv triv and small}.
	In fact, it will have small rank as it filters through a projection.
	Furthermore, if that projection collapses the $i$th coordinate, then each face $\sigma \delta_j^\epsilon$ for $j\neq i$ will also be a degenerate small cube and so have small rank, while the term $\pm (\sigma \delta_i^0-\sigma \delta_i^1)$ will be trivial with the trivializing map $\rho$ being the interchange of the two faces.
	Thus, the degenerate smooth singular cubes are elements of $Q_*(M)$, and our map is well defined in each degree.

	For compatibility of boundary orientations, consider the $k-1$ dimensional face $F$ of $\interval^k$ given by $x_i = j$ with $j\in\{0,1\}$.
	Then we have an outward pointing vector given by $(-1)^{j+1}e_i$, where $e_i$ is the standard unit vector in the $i$th direction.
	The boundary orientation $\beta_F$ for $F$ as a manifold with corners is the one such that
	$(-1)^{j+1}e_i \wedge \beta_F$ is the orientation $e_1 \wedge\cdots\wedge e_k$ of $\interval^k$.
	Thus $\beta_F = (-1)^{j+1+i-1}e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \hat{e}_i \wedge \cdots e_j$.
	On the other hand, $e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \hat{e}_i \wedge \cdots e_k$ is precisely the standard orientation of $F$ when considering $\interval^k$ as a cubical complex.
	So the manifold with corners boundary orientation of $F$ is $(-1)^{i+j}$ times its standard orientation as a cube.
	But this corresponds precisely to the formula for the boundary in $K^{sm}_*(M)$ given by \eqref{E: cube bd}.
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
	As the cubes $\interval^k$ are compact manifolds with corners equipped with their standard orientations,
	we have $SK^{sm}_*(M) \into PC_*^\Gamma$.
	Furthermore, any degenerate singular cube $\sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$ is also degenerate in the sense of Definition \ref{D: equiv triv and small}.
	In fact, it will have small rank as it filters through a projection.
	Furthermore, if that projection collapses the $i$th coordinate then each face $\sigma \delta_j^\epsilon$ for $j\neq i$ will also be a degenerate small cube and so have small rank, while the term $\pm (\sigma \delta_i^0-\sigma \delta_i^1)$ will be trivial with the trivializing map $\rho$ being the interchange of the two faces.
	Thus, the degenerate smooth singular cubes are elements of $Q_*(M)$.
	As in the simplicial case one can check compatibility of boundary orientations so that we have a chain map $NK^{sm}_*(M) \to C_*^\Gamma(M)$.

\end{comment}

\begin{theorem}\label{T: hom iso map}
	Let $M$ be a manifold without boundary.
	The maps $H_*(S^{sm}_*(M)) \to H_*^\Gamma(M)$ and $H_*(NK^{sm}_*(M)) \to H_*^\Gamma(M)$ obtained by treating smooth singular simplices and smooth singular cubes as elements of $C_*^\Gamma(M)$ are isomorphisms.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Both $H_*(S^{sm}_*(M))$ and $H_*(NK^{sm}_*(M))$ are isomorphic to the standard singular homology groups, so in the following we simply write $H_*$ for either of these theories and provide a uniform proof.
	We let $\Phi$ denote either of the chain maps of \cref{L: singular and cubical chain maps}, using the normalized chains in the cubical case.

	We apply \cite[Theorem 5.1.1]{Frie20}, which is based on standard Mayer--Vietoris techniques.
	We first observe that on the category consisting of the open subsets of $M$, the maps $\Phi: H_*(-) \to H_*^\Gamma(-)$ determined by the chain maps of \cref{L: singular and cubical chain maps} provide natural transformations of functors, which is clear from the definitions.
	We need to verify the following three properties:

	1.
	On $\emptyset$ or $U \subset M$ with $U$ homeomorphic to $\R^m$, the map $\Phi: H_*(U) \to H_*^\Gamma(U)$ is an isomorphism.
	As both $H_*$ and $H_*^\Gamma(-)$ are homotopy functors, we know from the respective Dimension Axioms (see \cref{E: dimension}) that in this case $H_k(U) = H_k^\Gamma(U) = 0$ for $k\neq 0$, while for $k = 0$ we have the commutative diagram
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		H_0(pt) \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "\Phi"] & H_0(U) \arrow[d, "\Phi"] \\
		H_0^\Gamma(pt) \arrow[r] & H^\Gamma_0(U).
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	The horizontal maps are isomorphisms because these are homotopy functors, and the left hand vertical map is an isomorphism because $\Phi$ takes a generator of $H_0(pt) \cong \Z$ to a generator of $H_0^\Gamma(pt) \cong \Z$; see again \cref{E: dimension}.
	So the right hand map is also an isomorphism.

	The case of the empty set is clear as in this case both groups are trivial.

	2.
	$\Phi$ induces a commutative diagram of long exact Mayer--Vietoris sequences.
	This follows from basic homological algebra given the commutativity of the following diagram and its analogue for normalized smooth singular cubical chains
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
		S^{sm}_*(U \cap V) \arrow[r, "{(i_U, -i_V)}", hook] \arrow[d, "\Phi"] & S^{sm}_*(U) \oplus S^{sm}_*(V) \arrow[d, "\Phi \oplus \Phi"] \\
		C_*^\Gamma(U \cap V) \arrow[r, "{(i_U, -i_V)}", hook] & C_*^\Gamma(U) \oplus C_*^\Gamma(V).
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]

	3.
	If $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an increasing collection of open submanifolds of $M$ such that $\Phi \colon H_*(U_\alpha) \to H_*^\Gamma(U_\alpha)$ is an isomorphism for all $\alpha$, then $\Phi \colon H_*(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha) \to H_*^\Gamma(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$ is an isomorphism.
	This argument is standard given that both singular (simplicial or cubical) chains and geometric chains are represented by compact spaces: If $W$ represents a cycle in $C_*^\Gamma(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$, then $W \to \cup_\alpha U_\alpha$ factors through some particular $U_\beta$, so, as $H_*(U_\beta) \xr{\Phi}H_*^\Gamma(U_\beta)$ is an isomorphism, $\uW$ is in the image of $H_*(U_\beta) \xr{\Phi}H_*^\Gamma(U_\beta) \to H_*^\Gamma(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$.
	But then $\uW$ is in the image of the composition $H_*(U_\beta) \to H_*(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha) \to H_*^\Gamma(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$, so $\Phi \colon H_*(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha) \to H_*^\Gamma(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$ is surjective.
	Similarly, if $\Phi \colon H_*(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha) \to H_*^\Gamma(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$ maps a class represented by a smooth singular cycle $\xi$ to $0$, then $\xi$ bounds as a geometric cycle, so by \cref{R: cycles and boundaries} there is some $Z \in PC_*^\Gamma(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$ so that $\bd Z \amalg -\xi \in Q_*(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$.
	But by compactness, there is some $\beta$ so that $Z$ and $\xi$ both have image in $U_\beta$.
	So $\xi$ represents a class in $H_*(U_\beta)$ that maps to $0$ in $H_*^\Gamma(U_\beta)$.
	As $\Phi$ is assumed an isomorphism on $U_\beta$, it must be that $\xi$ represents $0$ in $H_*(U_\beta)$, and so it also represents $0$ in $H_*(\cup_\alpha U_\alpha)$.

	It now follows from Theorem \cite[5.1.1]{Frie20} that $\Phi: H_*(M) \to H_*^\Gamma(M)$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\cref{T: hom iso map} is claimed without proof in \cite[Section 10]{Lipy14}.
Lipyanskiy states ``The fact that the natural maps induce isomorphisms follow from the standard Mayer--Vietoris arguments.'' However, these arguments are not given and no Mayer--Vietoris sequence is proven to exist in \cite{Lipy14}, though the main required tool, creasing, is provided.

Unfortunately, providing a direct comparison for cohomology theories is not so straight forward as there is no obvious map between $C^*_\Gamma(M)$ and $S^*(M) = \Hom(S_*(M),\Z)$.
It will take some work in the following sections to develop a geometric connection between these cohomology theories.

\subsection{Appendix: smooth singular cubes}\label{S: smooth cubes}

In this appendix, we show that normalized singular cubical chains and normalized smooth singular cubical chains provide the same homology theory, analogous to the case for the perhaps more familiar simplicial chains.

\begin{proposition}\label{P: singular smooth cubes}
	The inclusion $\psi: NK^{sm}_*(M) \into NK_*(M)$ is a chain homotopy equivalence.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	The proof is analogous to the simplicial case as given in detail in \cite[Theorem 18.7]{Lee13}, though we need to take care with degenerate cubes, which is not an issue in the simplicial case.
	To account for this, we sketch the proof in \cite{Lee13} but provide some detailed modifications.

	We first observe that the map $SK^{sm}_*(M) \to NK_*(M)$ takes a smooth singular cubical chain to $0$ only if all of its cubes (with non-zero coefficient) are degenerate, and so we do have an injection $NK^{sm}_*(M) \into NK_*(M)$.
	We will define cube-wise a chain homotopy inverse $s \colon NK_*(M) \to NK^{sm}_*(M)$ by starting with a map $\td s \colon SK_*(M) \to SK^{sm}_*(M)$ and passing to quotients.

	Recall from \cref{S: homology is homology} that we write $\delta_i^\epsilon$ for the face inclusions of the standard cubes.
	If $\sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$ is a singular cube, we define homotopies $H_\sigma \colon \interval^k \times \interval = \interval^{k+1} \to M$ so that the following properties hold:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item\label{I: smooth} $H_\sigma$ is a homotopy from $\sigma$ to a smooth map $\td \sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$.

		\item\label{I: faces} $H_{\sigma \delta_i^\epsilon} = H_\sigma \circ (\delta_i^\epsilon \times \id_\interval)$ so that the construction is compatible along faces.
		More explicitly, $H_{\sigma \delta_i^\epsilon}(x,t) = H_\sigma(\delta_i^\epsilon(x),t)$.

		\item\label{I: already smooth} If $\sigma$ is already smooth then $H_{\sigma}(x,t) = \sigma(x)$, i.e.\ the homotopy is constant.

		\item\label{I: degen} If $\sigma$ is independent of the coordinate $x_i$, then so is $H_\sigma$.
	\end{enumerate}

	The last condition, which we have added for cubes, ensures that if $\sigma$ is degenerate so will be $H_\sigma$ and $\td \sigma$.

	The construction is by induction on dimension.
	If $\sigma$ is a $0$-cube, then we define $H_\sigma(x,t) = \sigma(x)$, the constant homotopy.
	This satisfies the conditions.
	We then assume $H_\sigma$ defined with these properties for all cubes of dimension $<k$ and extend the definition to $k$-cubes.
	If $\sigma$ is already smooth, then the constant homotopy $H_\sigma(x,t) = \sigma(x)$ satisfies the conditions, noting that if $\sigma$ is smooth then so is each $\sigma \circ \delta_i^\epsilon$.
	If $\sigma$ is not smooth, we consider separately the two cases when $\sigma$ is degenerate or nondegenerate.

	First suppose $\sigma$ is not degenerate.
	By the induction hypothesis and Condition \eqref{I: faces}, $H_\sigma$ is determined on the subspace $(\interval^k \times 0) \cup ((\bd \interval^k) \times \interval)$.
	One can check as in the proof of \cite[Lemma 18.8]{Lee13} that Condition \eqref{I: faces} guarantees that the faces glue to form a continuous map.
	As $\bd \interval^k \into \interval^k$ is a the inclusion of a CW subcomplex, it is a cofibration, so there is a retraction $\interval^k \times \interval \to (\interval^k \times 0) \cup ((\bd \interval^k) \times \interval)$ \cite[Theorem VII.1.3]{Bred97}.
	The composition of the retraction with $H_\sigma$ as defined on the subspace determines a homotopy $F \colon \interval^k \times \interval \to M$ such that $F(-,1)$ is smooth on each $k-1$ face of $\bd \interval^k$.
	In fact, this implies that $F(-,1)$ is smooth on all of $\bd \interval^k$ by a minor modification of \cite[Lemma 18.9]{Lee13}.
	So by the Whitney Approximation Theorem \cite[Theorem 6.26]{Lee13}, there is a homotopy rel $\bd \interval^k$ from $F(-,1)$ to a smooth map $\td \sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$; we denote this homotopy $G$.
	Finally, let $u \colon \interval^k \to (0,1]$ be a continuous function that takes $\bd\interval^k$ to $1$ and the interior of the cube to $(0,1)$.
	Then we can define
	\begin{equation*}
		H_\sigma(x,t) =
		\begin{cases}
			F\left(x,\frac{t}{u(x)}\right),&x \in \interval^k, 0 \leq t \leq u(x),\\
			G\left(x,\frac{t-u(x)}{1-u(x)}\right),&x \in \text{Int}(\interval^k), u(x) \leq t \leq 1.\\
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
	One can check as in the proof of \cite[Lemma 18.8]{Lee13} that this is a continuous homotopy that satisfies the first two conditions above, as required.

	Next, suppose $\sigma$ is degenerate, i.e.\ there is some coordinate $x_i$ so that $\sigma$ does not depend on $x_i$.
	Let $\pi_i \colon \interval^k\to\interval^{k-1}$ be given by $\pi_i(x_1,\ldots, x_k) = (x_1,\ldots, \hat x_i, \ldots, x_k)$ with the $x_i$ term omitted.
	In this case, we define $H_\sigma(x,t)$ by
	\[H_\sigma(x,t) = H_{\sigma \delta_i^0}(\pi_i(x),t) = H_{\sigma \delta_i^1}(\pi_i(x),t).\]
	The two expressions on the right are equal due to $\sigma$ not depending on $x_i$.
	We claim that if there are multiple coordinates of which $\sigma$ is independent then this definition is independent of the choice of such coordinate.
	This is clear for $1$-cubes for which there is only one possible coordinate.
	Suppose then the claim proven in dimensions $<k$ and that $\sigma \colon \interval^k \to M$ is independent of $x_j$ and $x_i$ with $j<i$.
	Since $\sigma$ is independent of $x_j$, so is $\sigma \circ \delta_i^0$, so inductively $H_{\sigma \delta_i^0}(\pi_i(x),t) = H_{\sigma \delta_i^0\delta_j^0}(\pi_j\pi_i(x),t)$.
	Similarly, using that the $i$th coordinate of the cube is the $i-1$-st coordinate of the $j$th faces, we have $H_{\sigma \delta_j^0}(\pi_j(x),t) = H_{\sigma \delta_j^0\delta_{i-1}^0}(\pi_{i-1}\pi_j(x),t)$.
	But $\delta_i^0\delta_j^0$ and $\delta_j^0\delta_{i-1}^0$ determine the same $k-2$ face of $\interval^k$, and $\pi_j\pi_i(x) = \pi_{i-1}\pi_j(x)$.
	So both constructions give the same $H_\sigma$.

	With this definition of $H_\sigma$, Conditions \eqref{I: smooth}, \eqref{I: already smooth}, and \eqref{I: degen} hold by construction and by induction.
	We must verify Condition \eqref{I: faces}.
	If $\sigma$ is independent of $x_i$, the condition is clear by construction for the faces $\sigma\delta_i^0$ and $\sigma\delta_i^1$.
	For $j\neq i$, first suppose $i<j$.
	As $\sigma$ is independent of $x_i$, so is $\sigma\delta_j^\epsilon$, so
	\begin{align*}
		H_{\sigma\delta_j^\epsilon}(x,t)& = H_{\sigma\delta_j^\epsilon \delta_i^0}(\pi_i(x),t)\\
		& = H_{\sigma \delta_i^0\delta_{j-1}^\epsilon}(\pi_i(x)),t)\\
		& = H_{\sigma \delta_i^0}(\delta_{j-1}^\epsilon\pi_i(x)),t)\\
		& = H_{\sigma \delta_i^0}(\pi_i(\delta_j^\epsilon(x)),t)\\
		& = H_\sigma(\delta_j^\epsilon(x),t).
	\end{align*}
	Here the first equality uses our definition of $H_{\sigma\delta_j^\epsilon}$ as $\sigma\delta_j^\epsilon$ is independent of $x_i$.
	The second equality is an identity for cubical face inclusions; see \cite[Section 4]{GrMa03} or below in \cref{S: cubes}.
	The third is Condition \eqref{I: faces} for $H_{\sigma \delta_i^0}$, which holds by induction hypothesis.
	The fourth equality is another cubical identity, and the last is the definition of $H_\sigma$.

	Similarly, if $j<i$, then $\sigma\delta_j^\epsilon$ is independent of its $i-1$-st coordinate, and we compute analogously:

	\begin{align*}
		H_{\sigma\delta_j^\epsilon}(x,t)& = H_{\sigma\delta_j^\epsilon \delta_{i-1}^0}(\pi_{i-1}(x),t)\\
		& = H_{\sigma \delta_{i}^0\delta_{j}^\epsilon}(\pi_{i-1}(x)),t)\\
		& = H_{\sigma \delta_{i}^0}(\delta_{j}^\epsilon\pi_{i-1}(x)),t)\\
		& = H_{\sigma \delta_{i}^0}(\pi_{i}(\delta_j^\epsilon(x)),t)\\
		& = H_\sigma(\delta_j^\epsilon(x),t).
	\end{align*}

	This completes our construction of the homotopies $H_\sigma$ satisfying the desired conditions.
	We can now define $\td s \colon SK_*(M) \to SK^{sm}_*(M)$ by $\td s(\sigma) = H_\sigma(-,1)$.
	This is a chain map thanks to Condition \eqref{I: faces}:
	\begin{align*}
	\bd \td s(\sigma) &= \bd H_\sigma(-,1)\\
	&=\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^i (H_\sigma(-,1) \delta_i^0 - H_\sigma(-,1) \delta_i^1)\\
	&=\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^i (H_{\sigma \delta_i^0}(-,1) - H_{\sigma \delta_i^1}(-,1))\\
	&=\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^i (\td s(\sigma \delta_i^0) - \td s(\sigma \delta_i^1))\\
	&= \td s(\bd \sigma).
	\end{align*}

	If $\td \psi: SK_*^{sm}(M) \to SK_*(M)$ is the inclusion, we have by definition that $\td s \td \psi = \id$.
	We show that $\td\psi\td s$ is chain homotopic to the identity.\footnote{Here, finally, is a step that is easier in the cubical setting as we do not need to subdivide prisms into simplices.}
	Indeed, if $\sigma$ is a singular $k$-cube then treating $H_\sigma$ as a singular $k+1$ cube we have

	\begin{align*}
		\bd H_\sigma& = \sum_{i = 1}^{k+1} (-1)^i\left(H_\sigma \delta_i^0-H_\sigma \delta^1_i\right)\\
		& = \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{k} (-1)^i\left(H_\sigma (\delta_i^0 \times \id_\interval)-H_\sigma (\delta^1_i \times \id_\interval)\right)\right) +(-1)^{k+1}(H_\sigma(-,0)-H_\sigma(-,1))\\
		& = \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{k} (-1)^i\left(H_{\sigma \delta_i^0}-H_{\sigma\delta^1_i}\right)\right) +(-1)^{k+1}(\sigma -\td \psi\td s(\sigma)).
	\end{align*}
	So if we define $\td J(\sigma) = (-1)^{k+1}H_\sigma$ for a singular $k$-cube $\sigma$, we obtain
	\begin{align*}
		(-1)^{k+1}\bd \td J(\sigma)& = \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{k} (-1)^i\left( (-1)^k\td J(\sigma \delta_i^0)-(-1)^k\td J(\sigma\delta^1_i)\right)\right) +(-1)^{k+1}\left(\sigma(-)-\td \psi\td s(\sigma)\right)\\
		& = (-1)^k\td J(\bd \sigma)+(-1)^{k+1}(\sigma - \td \psi\td s(\sigma)),
	\end{align*}
	so $$\bd \td J(\sigma)+\td J(\bd \sigma) = \sigma - \td \psi\td s(\sigma),$$
	which shows that $\td \psi\td s$ is chain homotopic to the identity.

	Finally, we note that $\td \psi$, $\td s$, and $\td J$ all take degenerate simplices to degenerate simplices by definition and construction, so $\td \psi$ and $\td s$ descend to chain maps $\psi \colon NK_*^{sm}(M) \to NK_*(M)$ and $s \colon NK_*(M) \to NK_*^{sm}(M)$ with $s\psi = \id$ and $\td J$ descends to a chain homotopy $J \colon NK_*(M) \to NK_{*+1}(M)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Geometric homology with coefficients}

In this brief section, we consider geometric homology with coefficients in an arbitrary abelian group $G$.

\begin{definition}
	Let $M$ be a manifold with corners and $G$ an abelian group.
	We define the chain complex $C_*^\Gamma(M;G)$ of \textbf{geometric chains with coefficients in $G$}\index{geometric chains!with coefficients} to be $C_*^\Gamma(M) \otimes_\Z G$.
	The corresponding \textbf{geometric homology groups with coefficients}\index{geometric homology!with coefficients} will be denoted $H_*^\Gamma(M;G)$.
\end{definition}

In the remainder of the section, we will simply write $\otimes$ rather than $\otimes_Z$.

As $C_*^\Gamma(M)$ and its subgroups are torsion-free, and hence flat as $\Z$-modules, the Universal Coefficient Theorem applies, and so for each $i$, $$H_i^\Gamma(M;G) \cong \left(H_i^\Gamma(M) \otimes G \right) \oplus \left(H_{i-1}^\Gamma(M) * G \right),$$
letting $*$ denote the torsion product as in \cite{Munk66}.

Generalizing \cref{T: hom iso map,P: singular smooth cubes}, we have the following, which says that geometric homology with coefficients is ordinary homology with coefficients.

\begin{theorem}\label{T: hom iso map G}
	Let $M$ be a manifold without boundary.
	The maps $H_*(S_*(M;G)) \leftarrow H_*(S^{sm}_*(M;G)) \to H_*^\Gamma(M;G)$ and $H_*(NK_*(M;G)) \leftarrow H_*(NK^{sm}_*(M;G)) \to H_*^\Gamma(M;G)$ obtained by tensoring the corresponding integer-coefficient chain complex inclusions with $G$ are isomorphisms.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We note again that $C_*^\Gamma(M)$ and its subgroups are torsion-free, and hence flat as $\Z$-modules.
	The other chain complexes are all free; in the case of the normalized cubical complexes, they are generated by the nondegenerate singular cubes, which in each case constitute a free summand of the (smooth) group of singular cubes.
	So all of our chain maps induce maps of universal coefficient short exact sequences, and the claim follows from the Five Lemma.
\end{proof}
