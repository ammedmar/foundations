\begin{abstract}
	This manuscript develops a geometric approach to ordinary cohomology of smooth manifolds, constructing a cochain complex that computes it using co-oriented smooth maps from manifolds with corners.
	Special attention is given to the pull-back product of such smooth maps, which provides our cochain model with a multiplicative structure inducing the ring structure in cohomology.
	A parallel treatment of homology and cap product is also presented.
