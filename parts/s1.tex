\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

We fully develop a geometric approach to ordinary homology and cohomology on smooth manifolds,
with  classes represented by smooth maps from manifolds to our target manifold of interest.  
Such a goal is in line with thinking about homology dating back to Poincar\'e and Lefschetz, but is also a time honored approach to cohomology
through Poincar\'e Duality or Thom classes.
Such representation naively posed is an impossible goal due to the seminal work of Thom on bordism theory, 
which showed that not all homology classes can be represented by pushing forward fundamental classes of manifolds.
Our goal is also to model multiplicative structure (and in sequel research derived versions of such) through intersection,  also of course
in line with classical perspective.  Both Thom's obstructions and the desire to model multiplication then require
 a broader notion of manifold.  The one we utilize here is manifolds with corners, the smallest category containing manifolds with boundary, as
 needed to define homologies, and which is closed under pull-back, which we use for product.
 
Approaches to ordinary homology and cohomology were an active area of development  eighty years ago, and indeed we highlight
that our work is parallel to de Rham theory, allowing one to make calculations and invoke geometry for manifolds, rather than rely on
 transcendental approaches
to cochains as formal linear duals or homotopy classes of maps.  For just one example, Cochran in *** relates Seifert surface intersections with
Massey products in the context of Milnor invariants for links.  
 Compared with de Rham theory, our present work has
 the key advantage of being defined over the integers.  But this 
project is more contemporary than one would assume.  Gauge theorests have been revisiting these ideas as a parallel to work on Floer
theory, with both Lipyanskiy  \cite{Lipy14} and Joyce \cite{Joyc15} offering versions.   In a similar vein, Kreck's
 ``differential algebraic topology'' \cite{Krec10},  provides homology and cohomology on smooth manifolds using maps from \textit{stratifolds}, 
 a certain kind of singular space.   Even the foundations of 
a  theory of transversality for manifolds with corners suitable for our work
has only in the last decade
been worked out by Joyce \cite{Joy12}.

We take Lipyanskiy's approach and extend it to fully treat mulitplicative structure, along the way filling in details needed.  While it may not seem
surprising that one can capture ordinary homology, especially, in this way -- after all simplices and cubes are manifolds with corners -- 
the technicalities in this setting are surprising.  In particular, the boundary of a boundary of a manifold with corners is not empty or even zero is a chain.  
Following Lipyanskiy, we simply quotient by the  image of the  boundary squared, but now our chains and cochains are themselves equivalence classes.
Guaranteeing the dimension axiom seems to require further quotienting.  (It is an open question, to our knowledge, whether this is necessary,
but we see relatively little advantage if it is not since chains and cochains must be equivalence classes to force $d^2 = 0$.)   Once one is working with
such equivalence classes, and needs for example transversality to define products, truly substantial difficulties arise.  Indeed, at one point we 
doubted that a well-defined multiplication existed.

While the idea of homology as represented by fundamental classes of submanifolds or more generally manifolds mapping is highly familiar, 
it was only in some  corners of 20th century geometric topology -- namely intersection theory--  that \textit{co}homology classes were also  represented by appropriate maps from manifolds. More specifically, we consider proper and co-oriented smooth maps from manifolds with corners, 
with associated degree of the class given by the codimension of the map.
Such cochains are geometric objects in their own right, which (partially) evaluate on chains through intersection.
A great benefit to such thinking is that the classical operations of algebraic topology, such as cup and cap products, can be described \textit{at the level of cochains} by simple geometric operations based on intersection without recourse to algebraic diagonals, Alexander-Whitney maps, or other such combinatorics.
%In fact, when our cochains are represented by transverse embeddings, their cup product is simply their intersection.
%So, in fact, is the cap product.
%More generally, these products are represented by pullbacks or fiber products.
This again is reminiscent of the original classical thinking about such products in terms of intersections.
(A modern summary and treatment of such intersections in the PL category can be found in \cite{McC06}.)
The trade-off for such a pleasant description is that these intersections are not always defined; they require transversality.
This limitation is also classically anticipated by the famous commutative cochain problem.  
Loosely speaking, no integral cochain construction computing ordinary cohomology can be made canonically into a (graded) commutative ring.
Since the process of forming intersections is commutative, the algebra structure it induces cannot be fully defined.  We find the trade-off worthwhile,
and in  work building on these foundations 
 \cite{FMS-flows}  have already ``married'' the imperfect theory we develop here and combinatorially defined cup product 
%We will not let that stop us --- no theory is perfect.


 Lipyanskiy's  unpublished manuscript \cite{Lipy14} on which we build gives a fairly thorough account of geometric homology, 
 but a much more lightly sketched account of geometric cohomology.
Several of the major theorems are unproven or have arguments just hinted at.
% anibal: this last clause reads weird to me
Some other expected results are not stated at all, including an isomorphism, either as graded abelian groups or rings, between geometric and ordinary cohomology.
So one of our main goals is to give a thorough account, with detailed proofs, of geometric homology and cohomology, with our primary focus on geometric cohomology, both because Lipyanskiy's account of this requires filling in and also because cohomology with its algebra structure
is of more  interest us.
In fact, we found Lipyanskiy's work, thanks to Mike Miller, while working on \cite{FMS-flows} and looking for a rigorous foundation to geometrically model the cup product.   Ultimately we hope to obtain a full -- but partially defined --  $E_\infty$ structure on geometric cohains, with the $E_\inffy$ structure ``resolving''
partial defined-ness (though itself being partially defined!) rather than non-commutativity.


%Another important background piece that we could not find properly worked out in the literature (perhaps more due to our own ignorance than its non-existence) is co-orientation of smooth maps.
%Roughly speaking, a map of manifolds is co-oriented when a loop in the domain is orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing if and only if its image loop in the target has the same property.
%As we shall see, the co-orientability requirement allows maps of non-orientable manifolds to serve as geometric cochains, and they are important to the theory\footnote{While co-orientations are central to our approach, surprisingly they do not seem to be absolutely essential, as Kreck's cohomology theory in \cite{Krec10} does not utilize them.
%On the other hand, Kreck requires his targets to be oriented and handles non-orientable manifolds via a nice trick with double covers.
% greg: Double check and add specific references
%He also does not work as directly with cochain level products, for which we find the use of co-orientations to be a bit more natural}.
%For example, the identity map of any smooth connected manifold, orientable or not, represents a generator of its $0$-th geometric cohomology.
%Co-orientations are more appropriate for cochains than orientations, as co-orientations ``pull back'' in a way that we will see orientations do not.
%We develop the notion and properties of co-orientation quite thoroughly, which we hope may be also of broader use.
