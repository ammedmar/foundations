NEED TO CHOOSE ORIENTATION OF TRACES SO THAT BOUNDARY WORKS OUT


\begin{lemma}\label{L: trans diag cube}
Let $M$ be a manifold without boundary and let $V$, $W$, and $Z$ be  manifolds with corners. Suppose $f:V\to M$ and $g:W\to M$ are transverse and that $f\times_Mg:V\times_MW\to M$ is transverse to $h:Z\to M$. Then $f\times g:V\times W\to M\times M$ is transverse to the composition $Z\xr{h}M\xr{\diag}M\times M$, where $\diag:M\to M\times M$ is the diagonal map.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We will apply \cref{L: transverse to pullback}. Consider the pullback diagram
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		& (V \times W)\times_{M\times M} M \arrow[r, "\pi_{V\times W}"] \arrow[d, "\pi_M"] & V\times W \arrow[d, "f\times g"] \\
		Z \arrow[r, "h"] & M \arrow[r, "\diag"]&  M\times M.
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
As $V$ and $W$ are transverse, we know that $f\times g:V\times W\to M\times M$ and $\diag:M\to M\times M$ are transverse by \cref{P: cross to cup}, and so by \cref{L: transverse to pullback}, the conclusion of the lemma holds if and only if $h$ is transverse to the projection $\diag^*(V\times W)=(V \times W)\times_{M\times M} M \to M$. But now by \cref{P: cross to cup} again, this pullback projection is precisely $f\times_Mg:V\times_MW\to M$. So the needed transversality holds by hypothesis.
\end{proof}



\begin{proposition}
Let $M$ be a smoothly cubulated manifold without boundary with cubulation $X$. Let $\uV,\uW\in H^*_\Gamma(M)$. Then the cohomology classes $\mc I(\uV\uplus\uW)\in H^*(K_X^*(M))$ and $\mc I(\uV) \smile \mc I(\uW)\in H^*(K_X^*(M))$ have the same image under the evaluation map $$H^*(K_X^*(M))\to \Hom(H_*(K_*^X(M)),\Z).$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $Z$ be a cubical cycle representing an element of $H_*(K_*^X(M))$. As in \cref{S: cubical products}, we can consider $Z$ to also represent a smooth normalized singular cubical chain in $NK_*(M)$. We also have from that section a smooth chain homotopy of normalized singular cubes  in $M\times M$ between $\diag(Z)$ and $\zeta\xi\diag(Z)$. Let $Y$ be a smooth singular cubical chain representing this homotopy. Since $Z$ is a cycle, we have (up to choice of orientation) $\bd Y=\diag(Z)-\zeta\xi\diag(Z)+Q$, where $Q$ is a degenerate singular cubical chain. Recall that we can also think of $\diag(Z)$, $\zeta\xi\diag(Z)$, and $Q$ as representing elements of $PC^\Gamma_*(M\times M)$. For simplicity of notation, we write $\diag(Z)$, $\zeta\xi\diag(Z)$ to represent these manifolds with corners, each of which is a union of signed cubes mapping to $M\times M$.

In order to proceed from here, we need to establish chain and cochain representatives with sufficient transversality to begin computing intersections.

First, choose $f:V\to M$ and $g:W\to M$ representing $\uV$ and $\uW$. Let $h$ be the map representing the cubulation, though of as a disjoint union of top-dimensional cubes mapping to $M$. We can let $X$ denote this disjoint union of cubes mapping to $M$ and note that this contains the same information as the cubulation. By \cref{T: transverse complex}, we can assume that $g:W\to M$ is transverse to the cubulation. So $W\times_MX$ is well defined as a manifold with corners mapping to $M$ (ignoring (co)-orientation considerations for the moment).
Next, let us consider the union $W\sqcup X\sqcup (W\times_M X)$ as a single manifold with corners over $M$. By \cref{P: perturb transverse to map} there is a proper universal homotopy from $f$ to a map $f':V\to M$ that is transverse to this union; $f'$ represents the same cohomology class as $f$ by and application of \cref{L: dessicated homotopy} and the definition of universal homotopy. Abusing notation, let us rechristen this new transverse map $f:V\to M$.  By \cref{P: 3 out of 4 trans}, since $W$ is transverse to $X$ and $V$ is transverse to both $W$ and $W\times_MX$, we also have that $X$ is transverse to $V\times_M W$.

Next, consider $V\times W$ in $M\times M$. As $V$ and $W$ are each transverse to the cubulation $X$, we have $V\times W$ transverse to the product cubulation $X\times X$ by the proof of \cref{P: oriented interchange}.
Also, as $V$ and $W$ are transverse and as $V\times_MW$ is transverse to the cubulation $X$, \cref{L: trans diag cube} shows that $V\times W$ is transverse to the cubulation of the embedded diagonal  $\diag(X)$. So, as $Z$ is a cubical chain with respect to the cubulation $X$ and $\zeta\xi\diag(Z)$ is composed of cubes of the product cubulation $X\times X$, we see that the singular cubical chains $\diag(Z)$ and  $\zeta\xi\diag(Z)$ are transverse to $V\times W$. So now by \cref{P: perturb transverse to map}, there is a universal homotopy $H$ that takes $Y$ (now considered as an element of $PC^\Gamma_*(M\times M)$) to a $Y'$ that is transverse to $V\times W$ and such that the traces of the restrictions of the homotopy to $\diag(Z)$ and  $\zeta\xi\diag(Z)$
are also transverse to  $V\times W$.

We construct an element $A\in PC^\Gamma_*(M\times M)$ from the end of the homotopy and the traces of $\diag(Z)$ and $\zeta\xi\diag(Z)$. To simplify notation, recall from \cref{S: covariant functoriality} that if we have $r_U:U\to M$ representing an element that we call $U\in PC^\Gamma_*(M)$ and if we have a map $F:M\to N$, then we write $F(U)$ for the corresponding element of $PC^\Gamma_*(M)$, represented by the composition $U\xr{r_U}M\xr{F}M$.
Utilizing this notation, also letting $H_1=H(-,1):M\times M\to M\times M$, we let $A\in PC^\Gamma_*(M\times M)$ be the union of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Y'=H_1(Y)$, i.e.\ if $r_Y:Y\to M\times M$ represents $Y$ as an element of $PC^\Gamma_*(M)$, then $Y'$ is represented by  the composition $Y\xr{r_Y} M\times M\xr{H_1}M\times M$,

\item $-H(\diag(Z)\times I)$, i.e.\ the homotopy $\diag(Z)\times I\xr{r_{\diag(Z)}\times \id_I} M\times M\times I\xr{H}M\times M$ with its opposite orientation,

\item $H(\zeta\xi\diag(Z)\times I)$, i.e.\ the homotopy $\zeta\xi\diag(Z)\times I\xr{r_{\zeta\xi\diag(Z)}\times \id_I} M\times M\times I\xr{H}M\times M$.
\end{enumerate}
Then as observed above, $A$ is transverse to $V\times W$, and we next compute $\bd A$. We have
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bd Y'=H_1(\bd Y)=H_1(\diag(Z)-\zeta\xi\diag(Z)+Q)=H_1(\diag(Z))-H_1(\zeta\xi\diag(Z))+H_1(Q)$,

\item $-\bd H(\diag(Z)\times I)=-H(\bd (\diag(Z)\times I))=-H_1(\diag(Z))+\diag(Z)-H((\bd\diag(Z))\times I)$,

\item $\bd H(\zeta\xi\diag(Z)\times I)=H(\bd (\zeta\xi\diag(Z)\times I))=H_1(\zeta\xi\diag(Z))-\zeta\xi\diag(Z)+H((\bd\zeta\xi\diag(Z))\times I)$.
\end{enumerate}
As $\bd Z=0$ as a cubical chain, it is trivial as a singular cubical chain or element of $PC_*^\Gamma(M)$, and so the terms involving $\bd\diag(Z)$ or $\bd\zeta\xi\diag(Z)$ are also trivial by \cref{L: dessicated homotopy}. Similarly, $H_1(Q)$ is trivial. So, in $C_*^\Gamma(X)$, we have $\bd Y=\bd A$.




Now, at last we can compute, treating $A$ as a manifold with corners. To fix our indices, we assume as usual that $\dim(M)=m$, $\dim(V)=v$, and $\dim(W)=w$, so $\dim(V\times_MW)= v+w-m$, which is the dimension of an $m-(v+w-m)=2m-v-w$ cochain. So we take $\dim(Z)=2m-v-w$, which implies $\dim(A)=\dim(Y)=2m-v-w+1$. So $\dim((V\times W)\times_{M\times M}A)=(v+w)+(2m-v-w+1)-2m=1$, and its boundary is $0$-dimensional and augments to $0$ by \cref{D: aug}. But, as $V$ and $W$ represent geometric cocycles,
this implies  $$\aug((V\times W)\times_{M\times M}\diag(Z))=\aug((V\times W)\times_{M\times M}\zeta\xi\diag(Z)).$$
We claim the former represents $(\mc I(\uV\uplus\uW))(Z)$ and the latter represents $(\mc I(\uV) \smile \mc I(\uW))(Z)$.

We first consider  $(V\times W)\times_{M\times M}\diag(Z)$, which is a cap product. By \cref{P: natural cap}, this is the same oriented manifold as $\diag^*(V\times W)\times_M Z$, which is $(V\times_MW)\times_M Z$ by \cref{P: cross to cup}.
So it follows from \cref{D: intersection homomorphism} and from the fact that $V\times_MW$ represents $\uV\uplus \uW$, that $$\aug((V\times W)\times_{M\times M}\diag(Z))=\aug((V\times_MW)\times_M Z)=\mc I(\uV\uplus \uW)(Z).$$

Next, consider $(\mc I(\uV) \smile \mc I(\uW))(Z)$. If $Z=\sum_i a_iE_i$, then by the discussion in \cref{S: cubical products}, we have
\begin{align*}
(\mc I(\uV) \smile \mc I(\uW))(Z)
&=\sum a_i (\mc I(\uV) \smile \mc I(\uW))(E_i)\\
&=\sum a_i\sum (\mc I(\uV) \otimes \mc I(\uW))  \rho_{H,K}A_H(E_i) \otimes B_K(E_i)\\
&=\sum a_i\sum \rho_{H,K}\mc I(\uV)(A_H(E_i))\cdot \mc I(\uW)(B_K(E))\\
&=\sum a_i\sum \rho_{H,K}\aug(V\times_M A_H(E_i))\aug(W\times_M B_K(E))\\
&=\sum a_i\sum \rho_{H,K}\aug((V\times W)\times_{M\times M}( A_H(E_i)\times B_K(E)))\\
&=\aug((V\times W)\times_{M\times M}\sum a_i\sum \rho_{H,K}( A_H(E_i)\times B_K(E)))\\
&=\aug((V\times W)\times_{M\times M}\zeta\xi\diag(Z)).\\
\end{align*}
Here the third equality is from the definition of the map $\mc I$ and the fourth utilizes \cref{P: cross product comparison}.
\end{proof}

CHECK CONVENTION ESTABLISHED FOR TENSOR PRODUCT OF COCHAINS ACTING ON CHAINS



We next recall that when $H^i(X)$ is finitely generated, there is an isomorphism $\lambda:T(H^i(X))\to \Hom(T(H_{i-1}(X));\Q/\Z)$, where $T(G)$ is the torsion subgroup of the abelian group $G$. A construction and proof can be found in \cite[Section 8.4.3]{Frie20}. The discussion there is in the context of intersection homology of singular spaces, but the relevant homological algebra applies in general for any cohomology groups coming from a cochain complex $C^*=\Hom(C_*,R)$, where $R$ is a Dedekind domain, $C_*$ is projective in each degree, and the homology and cohomology groups are all finitely generated. In this case, the map $\lambda$ can be described as follows. Let $\alpha$ be a cocycle representing an element of $T(H^i(X))$, and let $w$ be a cycle representing an element of $T(H_{i-1}(X))$. Since $w$ represents a torsion element of $H_{i-1}(X)$, there is a chain $z$ such that $\bd z=rw$ for some integer $r\neq 0$. Then $\lambda(\alpha)(w)=\frac{\alpha(z)}{r}$. It is shown in \cite{Frie20} that this construction is well defined, independent of the choices involved.

In the current setting we will apply this to cubical cohomology with integer coefficients, in which case the homological conditions are satisfied so long as each cohomology group --- or equivalently, each homology group --- is finitely generated.


\begin{proposition}
Let $M$ be a smoothly cubulated manifold without boundary with cubulation $X$, and suppose $H^i(X)$ is finitely generated for each $i$. Let $\uV,\uW\in H^*_\Gamma(M)$. Suppose the cohomology classes $\mc I(\uV\uplus\uW)$ and $\mc I(\uV) \smile \mc I(\uW)$ lie in $T(H^*(K_X^*(M)))$. Then they agree after composition with the map $$\lambda:T(H^*(K_X^*(M)))\to \Hom(H_{*-1}(K_*^X(M)),\Q/\Z).$$
\end{proposition}

UGH, WHAT IF ONE IS TORSION AND THE OTHER ISN'T?

--------------------------

Restart

For the next proposition, we need to further limit the cochains considered.
Let $M$ be a manifold without boundary cubulated by $X$.
Recall from SECTION ??? that $\zeta \xi \colon NK^s_*(M \times M) \to  NK^s_*(M \times M)$ is chain homotopic to the identity by \cite[Section XI.5]{Mas91}, and so $\zeta\xi \diag$, which we denoted $\Delta$ in \cref{D: Delta}, is chain homotopic to $\diag \colon K_*(X) \to NK^s_*(M \times M)$, thinking of $K_*(X)$ as a subcomplex of $NK_*^s(M)$.
Let $P \colon K_i(X) \to NK^s_{i+1}(M \times M)$ be a fixed chain homotopy such that $\diag - \Delta = \bd P - P \bd$.

We now define $C^*_{\Gamma \pf P} (M \times M)$ analogously to our definition of $C^*_{\Gamma \pf X}(M \times M)$ in \cref{D: trans cube} except instead of just being transverse to the cubulation, we require
$PC^*_{\Gamma \pf P} (M \times M)$ to consist of those elements of $V \in PC^*_{\Gamma}(M \times M)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V$ is transverse to each characteristic map of the cubulation $X \times X$ of $M \times M$,
\item $V$ is transverse to $\diag(E)$ for every $E$ in $X$,
\item $V$ is transverse to $P(E)$ for every $E$ in $X$.
\end{enumerate}

Due to the last condition, the maps that each $V$ must be transverse to are not all embeddings.
Nevertheless, a directly analogous construction to the discussion in \cref{D: trans cube} allows us to define $C^*_{\Gamma \pf P} (M \times M)$.

\begin{lemma}
	The inclusion $C^*_{\Gamma \pf P} (M \times M) \to C^*_\Gamma (M \times M)$ is a quasi-isomorphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof is identical to that of \cref{T: transverse complex} (DOUBLE CHECK), though since we do not need to be transverse only to faces of the cubulation, we use \cref{P: perturb transverse to map} rather than \cref{P: ball stability} to provide the needed transversality arguments.
As in \cref{R: countable trans} and the proof of \cref{P: ball stability}, \cref{P: perturb transverse to map} immediately generalizes to allow transversality with respect to the countable number of objects detailed above DOUBLE CHECK.
\end{proof}


Next, we notice that the chain map $\mc I \colon C^*_{\Gamma \pf X\times X}(M\times M) \to K^*(X \times I)$ of \cref{D: intersection homomorphism} restricts to a chain map on $C^*_{\Gamma \pf X\times P}(M\times M)$.
Furthermore, if we have any map $f \colon N \to M \times M$ that is transverse to every element of $C^*_{\Gamma \pf X\times P}(M\times M)$, then we have a pullback chain map $f^* \colon C^*_{\Gamma \pf X\times P}(M\times M) \to C^*_\Gamma(N)$ given by $f^*(\uV) = \underline{V \times_{M \times M} N}$ as a pullback mapping to $N$, where $V$ is any representative of $\uV$; cf.\ \cref{S: cohomology pullback,P: trans to f} DOUBLE CHECK ALL THIS.
This allows us to state our key proposition.

\begin{proposition}
	Let $M$ be a manifold without boundary with cubulation $X$, and let $C^*_{\Gamma \pf P}(M \times M)$ be as defined above.
	The following diagram commutes up to homotopy:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
	C^*_\Gamma(M) \arrow[d,"\mc I"] & C^*_{\Gamma \pf P}(M \times M) \arrow[l,"\diag^*"'] \arrow[d,"\mc I"] \\
	K^*(X) & \arrow[l,"(\Delta)^*"'] K^*(X\times X),
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	where $\Delta = \zeta \xi \diag$ as in \cref{D: Delta}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $V \in PC^*_\Gamma(M)$ represent an element of $C^*_{\Gamma \pf ???}(M \times M)$, and let $E$ be a cubical face of $X$.
	We first compute as follows:
	\begin{align*}
		(\mc I \diag^*(V))(E) & = \aug(\diag^*(V) \times_M  E) &\text{\cref{D: intersection homomorphism,D: intersection number}}\\
		&=\aug((V \times_{M \times M} M) \times_M E) &\text{\cref{D: cohomology pullback and homology transfer}}\\
		&=\aug(V \times_{M \times M} \diag(E)) &\text{\cref{P: natural cap}},
	\end{align*}
	where $\diag(E)$ denotes the map $E \xr{\diag} M$ in the notation of \cref{S: covariant functoriality}.
	On the other hand,
		\begin{align*}
		(\Delta^*\mc I(V))(E) & = \mc I(V)(\Delta E)\\
		&=\aug(V \times_{M \times M} (\Delta E)).
	\end{align*}

	Next, recall that in $NK^s_*(M \times M)$ we know that $\zeta \xi$ is chain homotopic to the identity by \cite[Section XI.5]{Mas91}, and so $\zeta\xi \diag = \Delta \colon $ is chain homotopic to $\diag$.
	Let $P \colon K_i(X) \to NK^s_{i+1}(M \times M)$ be the chain homotopy such that $\diag - \Delta = \bd P - P \bd$.
	We define $L \colon C^j_{\Gamma \pf ??}(M \times M) \to K^{j-1}(X)$ by $$L(\uV)(E) = \aug(V \times_{M \times M} P(E))$$
	for any representative $V$ of $\uV$ (WELL DEFINED BY).
	Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		((dL + L\bd)(V))(E) &=(dL(V))(E) + ((L\bd)(V))(E) \\
			& = L(V)(\bd E) +L(\bd V)(E)\\
			& = \aug(V \times_{M \times M} P(\bd E)) + \aug((\bd V) \times_{M \times M} P(E))\\
			& = \aug(V \times_{M \times M} P(\bd E)) + (-1)^{v+e+1}\aug(\bd(V \times_{M \times M} P(E)))+(-1)^{v+e}\aug(V \times_{M \times M} \bd P(E))\\
			&=\aug(V \times_{M \times M} P(\bd E)) +\aug(V \times_{M \times M} \bd P(E))\\
			&=\aug(V \times_{M \times M} (P\bd + \bd P)(E))\\
			&=\aug(V \times_{M \times M} (\diag - \Delta)(E))\\
			&=\aug(V \times_{M \times M} (\diag(E))) - \aug(V \times_{M \times M} \Delta)(E)\\
			&=(\mc I \diag^*(V))(E)- 	(\Delta^*\mc I(V))(E)\\
			&=((\mc I \diag^*(V)- \Delta^*\mc I)(V))(E).
	\end{align*}
	Here in the fourth line we use \cref{P: Leibniz cap}, and in the fifth line we use that $\aug \circ \bd =0$  and $\aug$ will be trivial unless $\dim(V)+ \dim(E) = \dim(M \times M) \equiv 0 \mod 2$.
	As $E$ and $V$ were arbitrary, we see that we have a chain homotopy between $\mc I \diag^*$ and $\Delta^*\mc I$.










\end{proof}
