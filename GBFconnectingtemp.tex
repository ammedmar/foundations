\begin{proposition}\label{P: natural connection}
	The connecting map $\delta$ is natural, i.e.\ for a continuous map  $f \colon U' \cup V' \to U \cup V$ such that $f(U') \subset U$ and $f(V' \subset V)$ with both $U \cap V$ and $U' \cap V'$ non-empty, the following diagram commutes for all $k$:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		H^k_\Gamma(U \cap V) \arrow[r, "\delta"] \arrow[d, "f^*"] & H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U \cup V) \arrow[d, "f^*"] \\
		H^k_\Gamma(U' \cap V') \arrow[r, "\delta"] & H^{k+1}_\Gamma(U' \cup V').
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{lemma}\label{L: cut pullback}
	Suppose $M$ and $N$ are manifolds without corners and that $\phi \colon N \to \R$ is smooth with $0$ a regular value.
	Suppose $W \in PC^*_\Gamma(N)$ and that $r_W \colon W \to N$ is transverse to $N^0$.
	Suppose $g \colon M \to N$ is smooth and transverse to both $W \to N$ and $W^0 \to N$.
	Then $(W \times_N M)^0$ and $W^0 \times_N M$ are co-oriented isomorphic over $M$, where in the first expression the splitting is with respect to the composite $\phi g$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We first note that $W^0 \times_N M$ is well defined as we assume $f$ is transverse to $W^0 \to N$.
	To see that $(W \times_N M)^0$ is well defined, let us write Let us write $r_W^*$ for the pullback, i.e.\ $r_W^* \colon W \times_N M \to W$.
	Then it suffices to show that the transversality of $g$ with $r_{W^0}$ implies that $0$ is a regular value for the composition $\phi g r_W^*$.
	So we must show that the restriction of $\phi gr_W^*$ to each stratum of $W \times_N M$ is transverse to $0$.
	Recall by \cref{pullback} that $S^k(W \times_N M) = S^k(W) \times_N M$, as $M$ is without boundary.
	Similarly, we note for a bit later that $$S^k(W^0) = S^k(N^0 \times_N W) = N^0 \times_N S^k(W) = (S^k(W))^0.$$
	So let $(x,y) \in S^k(W) \times_N M$ with $x \in S^k(W)$ and $y \in M$ be a point that maps to $0$ under $\phi gr_W^*$, and let $z = r_W(x) = g(y) \in N$.
	As $D_x(r_W|_{S^k(W)}) = D_xr_W|_{T_xS^k(W)}$, we will simply write $D_xr_W$ rather than $D_x(r_W|_{S^k(W)})$ in what follows.
	Now, recall that the tangent bundle of the pullback is the pullback of the tangent bundles by \cref{L: tangent of pullbacks}, so the tangent space of $S^k(W) \times_N M$ is $T_x S^k(W) \times_{T_{z}N} T_yM$.
	As $0$ is a regular value for $\phi r_W$, and so in particular a regular value for $\phi \circ r_W|_{S^k(W)}$, there must be a vector $\xi \in T_xS^k(W)$ with $D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)\neq 0$.
	So $D_xr_W(\xi) \neq 0$.
	As $g$ is assumed transverse to $W^0 \to N$, there must be $\alpha \in T_xS^k(W^0)$ and $\beta \in T_yM$ such that $D_xr_W(\xi) = D_xr_W(\alpha) + D_yg (\beta)$.
	Rewriting, $D_yg (\beta) = D_xr_W(\xi-\alpha)$.
	As $\alpha \in T_xW^0 \in \ker(D_x (\phi r_W))$, we have $$D_{z}\phi(D_yg (\beta)) = D_{z}\phi \circ D_xr_W(\xi-\alpha) = D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)-D_x(\phi r_W)(\alpha) = D_x(\phi r_W)(\xi)\neq 0.$$
	So, recalling that $Dr_W^*$ is simply the projection to $T_yM$, the pair $( \xi-\alpha, \beta)$ is a non-zero vector in $$T_{(x,y)}(S^k(W) \times_N M) = T_x S^k(W) \times_{T_{z}N} T_yM$$ that maps by $D(\phi gr_W^*)$ to $D_{z}\phi(D_yg (\beta)) \neq 0 \in T_{0}[-1,1]$.
	As $(x,y)$ was an arbitrary point of $(\phi gr^*_{W})^{-1}(0) \subset W \times_N M$, this shows that $0$ is a regular value for $\phi gr^*_W$.

	Now, from the definitions, $W^0 \times_N M = (N^0 \times_N W) \times_N M$, treating $N^0 \times_N W$ as a fiber product and $W^0 \times_N M$ as a pullback over $M$.
	On the other hand, $(W \times_N  M)^0 = M^0 \times_M (W \times_N M)$, where $W \times_N M$ is the pullback to $M$ and then we take the fiber product with $M^0$.
	In both cases, these translate to the pairs of points $(x,y) \in W \times M$ with $r_W(x) = g(y)$ and $\phi(r_W(x)) = \phi(g(y)) = 0$.
	In other words, as spaces these are both precisely the limit of the following diagram together with its map to $M$:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		& M \arrow[d,"g"] & \\
		W \arrow[r, "r_W"] & N \arrow[r, "\phi"] & {[-1,1]} & \arrow[l,hook'] 0
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	Thus $(W \times_N M)^0$ and $W^0 \times_N M$ are represented by the same map, and it remains to check the co-orientations.

	We return to the definitions of the pullback and fiber product co-orientations.
	It suffices to compare $(W \times_N M)^0$ and $W^0 \times_N M$ at an arbitrary point.
	We first consider the co-orientation in the form $(W \times_N M)^0$.
	For the pullback $W \times_N M \to M$, choose $e \colon W \into N \times \R^K$.
	At our chosen point, fix $\beta_N$ and choose $\beta_W$ so that $\omega_{r_W} = (\beta_W,\beta_N)$.
	Let $\nu$ be the Quillen-oriented normal bundle of $W$ in $N \times \R^K$ so that $\beta_W \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$, where $\beta_E$ is the standard orientation of $\R^K$.
	Then by definition the pullback map from $P = W \times_N M \subset M \times \R^K$ to $M$ is co-oriented by $(\beta_P,\beta_M)$ if we choose $\beta_P$ and $\beta_M$ such that $\beta_P \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \times \beta_E$, recalling that we let $\beta_\nu$ also denote the pulled back normal bundle of $P$ in $M \times \R^K$.
	We suppose we have chosen such $\beta_P$ and $\beta_M$.
	Next, let $M^0 \subset M$ have normal co-orientation $\beta_\phi$ determined by pulling back the standard orientation from $(-1,1)$, and similarly let $\beta_\phi$ denote the pullback normal co-orientation to $(W \times_N M)^0$.
	Then by \cref{P: codim 1 co-orient}, the co-orientation of the pullback $(W \times_N M)^0 = M^0 \times_M (W \times_N M) \to W \times_N M$ is $(\beta_Q,\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi)$ for any $\beta_Q$.
	The fiber product $(W \times_N M)^0 \into M$ is then co-oriented by the composition $(\beta_Q,\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi)*(\beta_P,\beta_M)$.
	So if we choose $\beta_Q$ so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi = \beta_P$ (or equivalently $\beta_Q$ and $\beta_M$ so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \wedge \beta_E$), the co-orientation is $(\beta_Q,\beta_M)$.
	\textbf{G. note to self: Double check that \cref{P: codim 1 co-orient} still works here given recent changes to its statement.}

	On the other hand, consider $(N^0 \times_N W) \times_N M = W^0 \times_N M \to M$.
	One again we fix $\beta_N$ and $\beta_W$ so that $\omega_{r_W} = (\beta_W,\beta_N)$.
	Again by \cref{P: codim 1 co-orient}, the co-orientation of the pullback $N^0 \times_N W \to W$ is $(\beta_{W^0},\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi)$ for any $\beta_{W^0}$, continuing to let $\beta_\phi$ denote any normal co-orientation pulled back via $\phi$.
	If we choose $\beta_{W^0}$ so that $\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi = \beta_W$ then we have $r_{W^0} \colon W^0 \to N$ co-oriented by $(\beta_{W^0},\beta_N)$.
	As $W^0 \subset W$, we can embed $W^0$ in $N \times \R^K$ via the composition $W^0 \into W \xhookrightarrow{e}N \times \R^K$, using the same $e$ and $K$ as above.
	As $\beta_W \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$ and $\beta_W = \beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi$, we have $\beta_{W^0} \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_N \wedge \beta_E$ so that $\beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu$ is the Quillen orientation for the normal bundle of $W^0$ in $N \times \R^K$.
	Using this to pull back $W^0 \to N$ to $W^0 \times_N M \to M$, by definition the pullback co-orientation is $(\beta_Q,\beta_M)$ when $\beta_Q$ and $\beta_M$ are chosen so that $\beta_Q \wedge \beta_\phi \wedge \beta_\nu = \beta_M \wedge \beta_E$.
	But this is exactly the same co-orientation we arrived at in the preceding paragraph.
	Thus the co-orientations of the two constructions agree.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{P: natural connection}]
	We first establish much notation.
	Let $M = U' \cup V'$ and $N = U \cup V$.
	Let $A = U' \cap V'$ and $B = U \cap V$.
	Let $r_W \colon W \to B \subset N$ represent an element $\uW \in H^*_\Gamma(B)$.
	Let $\psi \colon M \to [-1/2, 1/2]$ be separating for $U'$ and $V'$, and let $\phi \colon N \to [-1/2, 1/2]$ be separating for $U$ and $V$.
	We further suppose that $\phi$ separates $W$ over $U$ and $V$, treating $W$ as having image in $N$.
	Let $M^0$ and $W^0$ be determined by $\phi$ as in \cref{S: splitting and creasing}, and similarly, let $N^0$ be determined by $\psi$.
	We let $r_{W^0} \colon W^0 \to N$ be the reference map for $W^0$.
	By postcomposing $\psi$ with an orientation preserving-diffeomorphism of $[-1/2, 1/2]$, we may assume that $\pm 1/4$ are regular values for $\psi$; let $K = \psi^{-1}([-1/4, 1/4])$.

	Now, noting that $f(A) \subset B$, apply\footnote{To account for $W_0$, it suffices to choose $g_1$ transverse to the disjoint union of $r_{W^+} \colon W^+ \to M$ and $r_{W^-} \colon W^0 \to M$. For both $g_1$ and $g_1|_{M^0}$ to have the desired transversality, the proof of \cref{T: basic trans} can be modified slightly; by the same argument there, almost every $s \in D$ provides the desired transversality, so one chooses an $s \in D$ that gives transversality for both $M$ and $M^0$. Compare the proof of the Transversality Homotopy Theorem in \cite{GuPo74}, which assumes that our analogue of $M$ has boundary.} \cref{T: basic trans} to obtain $g_1 \colon A \to B$, a smooth approximation to $f|_A$ that is transverse to $r_W$ and $r_{W^0}$ and so that the restriction to $M^0$ is also transverse to $W$.
	Then $f^*(\uW) \in H^*_\Gamma(A)$ is represented by the pullback of $W$ by $g_1$ by \cref{D: cohomology pullback and homology transfer}.
	For clarity, we write this pullback as $g_1^*(W) = W \times_B A$.
	By \cref{L: transverse to pullback}, as $g_1|_{M^0}$ is transverse to $W$, the inclusion of $M^0$ into $N$ is transverse to $g_1^*(W)$.
	The fiber product $ - M^0 \times_M g_1^*(W)$ represents $\delta f^* (W)$ by \cref{D: connecting}.

	Next, let $K' = \psi^{-1}([-3/8, 3/8]) \subset A \subset M$.
	We may assume that $\psi$ was chosen so that $\pm 3/8$ are also regular values.
	As $\psi^{-1}(\pm 3/8)$ are bicollared submanifolds of $M$, the inclusion $K' \into A$ is a cofibration, e.g. via \cite[Theorem VII.1.5]{Bred97}.
	So we may extend to all of $M$ the restriction to $K' \times I$ of the homotopy from $f|_A$ to $g_1$.
	Let us call the resulting map $f' \colon M \to N$.
	By the usual construction of a homotopy extension by using a neighborhood deformation retraction, we may further construct $f'$ so that it takes a neighborhood of $K'$ to $B$ (because our homotopy of $A$, which is also a neighborhood of $K'$ does) and so that $f' = f$ outside this neighborhood.
	In particular, $f'$ takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,3/8])$ to $U$ and $\psi^{-1}([-3/8,1/2])$ to $V$.

	Next, we wish to approximate $f'$ by a homotopic map $g_2 \colon M \to N$ such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $g_2 = g_1$ on $K$,
		\item $g_2$ is smooth,
		\item $g_2$ is transverse to $W$ and $W^0$
		\item $g_2$ takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,3/8])$ to $U$ and $\psi^{-1}([-3/8,1/2])$ to $V$.
	\end{enumerate}
	We will show that we can construct such a $g_2$ in a lemma following the remainder of the proof of \cref{P: natural connection}.

	So, assuming $g_2$ exists, by definition $f^* \delta (\uW)$ is represented by the pullback of $-W^0 \to M$ by $g_2$, which we will write $g_2^*(-W^0) = - g_2^*(W^0)$.
	Now we apply, \cref{L: cut pullback} to see that $g_2^*(W^0)$ is isomorphic to $(g_2^*(W))^0$, where the latter expression is the splitting with respect to the composite $\phi g_2$.
	In other words, $g_2^*(W^0) = M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M g_2^*(W)$, writing $M^0_{\phi g_2}$ for the splitting of $M$ determined by the function $\phi g_2$.

	So we must compare this $M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M g_2^*(W)$ with $M^0_\psi \times_M g_1^*(W)$, where $M^0_\psi$ is the splitting of $M$ using $\psi$.

	We next observe that as $M^0_\psi$ is in the interior of $K$ where $g_1 = g_2$, we must have $M^0_\psi \times_M g_1^*(W) = M^0_\psi \times_M g_2^*(W)$.
	So we compare $M^0_{\phi g_2} \times_M g_2^*(W)$ with $M^0_\psi \times_M g_2^*(W)$.

	Now, consider the sets $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$. As $N = U \cup V$, we must have $M = g_2^{-1}(U) \cup g^{-1}(V)$.
	We have $g_2^{-1}(U)\setminus g_2^{-1}(V) = g_2^{-1}(U \setminus V)$, do $\phi g_2(g_2^{-1}(U)\setminus g_2^{-1}(V)) = \phi g_2(g_2^{-1}(U \setminus V)) \subset \phi(U \setminus V) =   -1/2$, and similarly  $g_2^{-1}(V)\setminus g_2^{-1}(U) = 1/2$.
	So $\phi g_2$ is a separating function on $M$ with respect to this decomposition.
	We also know $M^0_{\phi g_2}$ is transverse to $g_2^*(W)$, so $\phi g_2$ separates $g_2^*(W)$ over $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$.

	As we chose $g_2$ so that $g_2 = g_1$ on $K$ and so that it takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,3/8])$ to $U$ and $\psi^{-1}([-3/8,1/2])$ to $V$, we have $g_2^{-1}(U \setminus V) \subset \psi^{-1}([-1/2,-3/8])$ and $g_2^{-1}(V \setminus U) \subset \psi^{-1}([3/8,1/2])$.
	Now let $\psi_1$ be the composition of $\psi$ with a smooth non-decreasing map $a: [-1/2,1/2] \to [-1/2,1/2]$ such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $a([-1/2,-3/8]) = -1/2$
		\item $a([-3/8, -1/4]) \subset [-1/2, -1/4]$
		\item $a(x)=x$ for $x \in [-1/4,1/4]$
		\item $a([3/8,1/2]) = 1/2$
	\end{enumerate}
	(a small perturbation of a piecewise linear function will do).
	In this case $M^0_\psi = M^0_{\psi_1}$, so we have $M^0_\psi \times_M g_2^*(W) = M^0_{\psi_1} \times_M g_2^*(W)$.
	Furthermore, as $g_2^{-1}(U) \setminus g_2^{-1}(V) = g_2^{-1}(U \setminus V)$, and similarly reversing the roles of $U$ and $V$, we see $\psi_1$ separates $g_2^*(W)$ over $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$.

	Lastly, we observe that $g_2^{-1}(U) \cap g_2^{-1}(V) = g_2^{-1} (U \cap V) = g_2^{-1}(B)$, so $g_2$ maps this intersection into $U \cap V$.
	Therefore, the pullback $g_2|_{g_2^{-1} (B)}^* W$ is an element of $PC^*_\Gamma(g_2^{-1} (B))$.
	Finally, $M^0_\phi \times_M	g_2|_{g_2^{-1} (B)}^* (W) = M^0_\phi \times_M g_2^*(W)$ and $M^0_{\psi_1} \times_M g_2|_{g_2^{-1} (B)}^* (W) = M^0_{\psi_1} \times_M g_2^*(W)$, as $M^0_\phi$ and $M^0_{\psi_1}$ are both in $g_2^{-1} (B)$.
	But now, these are two splittings of $g_2^*(W) \in PC^*_\Gamma(g_2^{-1} (B))$ with respect to different separating functions over $g_2^{-1}(U)$ and $g_2^{-1}(V)$, and so they represent the same element of $H^*_\Gamma(M)$ by the proof of \cref{P: connecting}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
There exists a $g_2$ as claimed.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We will modify the proof of \cref{T: basic trans}.
	As in that argument, we suppose $N$ properly embedded as a closed manifold in some Euclidean space; then $N$ has a distance function inherited from Euclidean space, which we will denote $d$.

	First, on $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,-1/4])$, we consider the function $d(f'(x), V \setminus U)$.
	By our properties for $f'$, this is a positive function on a closed subset of $M$.
	Similarly, $d(f'(x), U \setminus V)$ is a positive function on $\psi^{-1}([1/4, -1/2])$.
	As $(0,\infty) \cong \R$, by the Tietze Extension Theorem we can extend these functions to a single function $\delta \colon M \to (0, \infty)$.
	We now apply Smooth Approximation\footnotemark to replace $f'$ with a homotopic function $g'$ that is smooth, such that $g' = f' = g_1$ on $K$, and such that $d(f'(x),g'(x))<\delta(x)/2$ for all $x \in M$.
	\footnotetext{A good proof that $f'$ is homotopic rel $K$ to a smooth map can be found in \cite[Theorem 6.26]{Lee13}. To obtain the distance bound, we modify the argument there to require that the $\td \delta$ in that proof also satisfies $\td \delta(x) < \delta(x)/4$. Noting that the tubular neighborhood in \cite{Lee13} is the same as an $\epsilon$-neighborhood in \cite{GuPo74}, we can now use a triangle equality argument as in our proof of \cref{T: basic trans} to see that the smooth approximation satisfies $d(f'(x),g'(x))<\delta(x)/2$.}


	Next, we modify the transversality portion of the proof of \cref{T: basic trans} to obtain $g_2$ as the map called $h(-,1)$ in that argument.
	For the modification, we replace the function $\eta$ with one that satisfies all the properties stated there except
	\begin{itemize}
		\item we take $\eta(x)=0$ on $K$, and
		\item on $M \setminus K$, $\eta(x) > 0$ and, in addition to its other size restrictions, we take $\eta$ sufficiently small that $d(H(x,s),g'(x)) < \delta(x)/2$.
		This can be done using the same argument as in the proof of \cref{T: basic trans} for the case of proper maps, using $\delta/2$ in the role of $\varepsilon$ (that part of the argument did not rely on any map being proper).
	\end{itemize}
	Then, continuing the argument of the preceding proof, $H(-,s)|_{M-K}$ is transverse to $W$ and $W^0$ for almost every $s \in D$, so we again choose such an $s_0$ and let $$h(x,t) = H(x, ts_0) = \pi(f(x) + \eta(x)ts_0),$$ now on all of $M$.
	Then $g_2$ is smooth and equal to $g_1$ on $K$ by construction.
	It is transverse to $W$ and $W^0$ on $K$ because $g_1$ is and on $M \setminus K$ by the choice of $s_0$.
	And finally to see $g_2$ takes $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,3/8])$ to $U$ and $\psi^{-1}([-3/8,1/2])$ to $V$, we use that $g_2(K) = g_1(K) \subset B = U \cap V$ and that our use of the bounding function $\delta$ ensures that images of points in $\psi^{-1}([-1/2,-1/4])$ remain a positive distance from $V \setminus U$, and similarly for $\psi^{-1}([1/4,1/2])$ and $U \setminus V$.
\end{proof}
